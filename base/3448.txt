From the Gongpa Rabsel (Clear Intent), the Sixth Mind Generation, verses 1-64
Second, the explanation of the sixth ground, the Manifest, consists of four parts: (1) the etymology of the ground and demonstration of the superiority of prajñāpāramitā, (2) praise of the perfection of wisdom, (3) explanation of suchness through the vision of profound dependent origination, and (4) concluding summary through expressing the qualities of the ground.
First, having attained the completely pure perfection of meditative concentration on the fifth ground, one turns toward the sixth ground - that is, dwelling in the supreme state of meditative equipoise. Based on that, the bodhisattva dwelling on the sixth ground, seeing the profound suchness of dependent origination which is merely this conditionality, attains cessation through dwelling in the supreme perfection of wisdom. Before that, on the fifth ground and so forth, cessation is not attained because there is no supreme excellence in the perfection of wisdom. Through mere excellence in the five perfections of generosity and so forth, one cannot attain cessation.
Because through superior wisdom the dharmatā that is like a reflection becomes manifest, and because of focusing on the truth of the path on the fifth ground, and because of being directly oriented toward attaining the qualities of perfect buddhahood, this ground is called "The Manifest."
Regarding the meaning of the second reason, although the Commentary explains it as the actualization of the path where consciousness and objects of consciousness are not apprehended, since on the fifth ground there is focus on the path truth, mentioned as the last of the four truths, and because one attains mastery in the coarse and subtle aspects of the four truths there, it means the perfection of wisdom skilled in the four truths on the sixth ground. The first reason shows the perfection of training in wisdom skilled in the forward and reverse sequences of dependent origination. Thus, through the perfection of these two wisdom trainings, it means the direct realization of the truths and dependent origination.
Thus, on this ground, when the three trainings in wisdom are perfected, to whatever degree calm abiding becomes superior, insight becomes superior to that same degree. Since the supreme perfection of meditative concentration is attained on the fifth ground, based on that, the perfection of wisdom becomes supreme here. Therefore, it is from here that one attains the unique absorption into cessation.
From the Precious Garland: "The sixth is called 'Directly Facing,' because it faces directly toward the Buddha's Dharma. Through familiarization with śamatha and vipaśyanā, because one expands through attaining cessation, as the ripening of that, one becomes Sunirmita, king of the gods. Because he cannot be outshone by śrāvakas, he pacifies those with excessive pride." Thus it is stated. Sunirmita refers to Nirmāṇarati.
Second, to demonstrate that the accumulations of generosity and so forth other than the perfection of wisdom depend on the perfection of wisdom for proceeding to the resultant ground, it is explained: Just as a single person with eyes can easily lead all groups of blind people to their desired destination, similarly, in this context of the path, wisdom—that is, the perfection of wisdom—takes hold of and thoroughly sustains the qualities of generosity and so forth that lack the eye of seeing suchness, and proceeds to the state of the Victor which is the result. This is because the perfection of wisdom sees without confusion what is and what is not the correct path.
From the Noble Condensed Sutra: "How could billions and billions of blind people without a guide, who do not even know the path, enter a city? Without wisdom, these five perfections, being without eyes and without a guide, cannot touch enlightenment." And from the Diamond Cutter: "For example, just as a person with eyes who has entered darkness sees nothing at all, likewise should one view a bodhisattva who gives gifts while falling into reification. Subhūti, for example, just as a person with eyes sees various forms when dawn breaks and the sun rises, likewise should one view a bodhisattva who gives gifts without falling into reification." The same applies to moral discipline and so forth.
The third has five parts: (1) promising to explain the profound meaning, (2) identifying the vessels for explaining the profound meaning, (3) how qualities arise when explained to them, (4) urging those who are suitable vessels to listen, and (5) how to explain the suchness of dependent origination.
First, regarding how when the sixth bhūmi bodhisattva previously saw dependent origination, they saw the suchness of "this arises in dependence on this": In response to this, the Commentary states that its inherent nature does not fall within the domain of us whose eyes of intelligence are completely covered by the thick cataract of ignorance. Rather, it becomes the domain of those dwelling on higher bhūmis, such as the sixth and so forth. Therefore, this is not something to be asked of us. Rather, it should be spoken of to those buddhas and bodhisattvas whose eyes of intelligence, anointed with the eye medicine of excellent vision of emptiness that destroys the cataract of ignorance, are free from the cataract of the affliction of ignorance.
Regarding questions about the direct realization of reality, the Teacher instructs to ask those ones. Just as applying eye medicine makes vision clearer rather than removing the eye, when one understands that applying the eye medicine of seeing emptiness makes the mind's eye clearer rather than removing the wisdom eye, one will not be tainted by the wrong view that denigrates by claiming there is no wisdom in noble ones' meditative equipoise. If one objects: "Don't the Mother Sutras and the Ten Grounds Sutra teach that bodhisattvas practicing prajñāpāramitā see the suchness of dependent origination? Therefore, explain by following the scriptures." However, since determining scripture's intended meaning is difficult, even someone like me cannot teach suchness based on scripture.
This is stated from the perspective of independent explanation. To demonstrate that one can ascertain the intent of scripture upon seeing that authoritative treatises teaching reality were composed by authoritative persons and that they explain scripture without distortion: Just as a bodhisattva of the sixth ground realizes the extremely profound Dharma, Ārya Nāgārjuna, having understood scripture without distortion, clearly taught the reality of phenomena in his Madhyamaka treatises through both scriptural quotations and reasoning. Therefore, just as reality is taught in Ārya Nāgārjuna's system, Candrakīrti will explain it exactly according to the system as established by Nāgārjuna.
If one asks how Noble Nāgārjuna unmistakenly ascertained the meaning of the definitive scriptures, it is known from scripture. As stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra: "In the southern region of Vedī, there will be a greatly renowned and glorious monk called by the name Nāga, who will destroy the positions of existence and non-existence. Having explained my vehicle, the unsurpassed Great Vehicle, in the world, and having accomplished the ground of Perfect Joy, he will go to Sukhāvatī." Thus it is stated that Nāgārjuna will comment on the definitive vehicle that is free from the two extremes of existence and non-existence.
This is explained in the Sublime Golden Light. It is the same one who took birth as the Licchavi youth named "Delightful to See for All Worlds" during the time when the Teacher was present. From the Great Cloud: "Four hundred years after I have passed into nirvana, this youth will become a monk named Naga and will spread my teaching extensively. Finally, in the realm called 'Utterly Pure Light,' he will become a victor named 'Light Source of Wisdom.'" Thus it was taught. Therefore, it is established that there exists an unerring certainty in the definitive scriptural meaning regarding this.
From Manjushri's Root Tantra also, the time of appearance and name are described similarly, and it states he would remain for six hundred years. The Great Drum Sutra states that this Licchavi youth Priyadarshana, when the teaching declined eighty years after the Teacher's passing, became a monk bearing the Teacher's name and caused the teaching to flourish. After living for one hundred years, he passed away and was reborn in Sukhavati. Elder Bhadra and Lord Atisha also accept this as a prophecy about this master, based on the explanation that Licchavi Priyadarshana and Nagarjuna share the same mental continuum. The Great Drum Sutra describes that monk as being on the seventh ground. Such explanations cannot be proven to contradict the previous ones, because there are many instances in the scriptures where certain great kings are described as stream-enterers in some texts while being described as buddhas in others.
Second, the definitive treatises should be relied upon only by those in whose mindstreams there has been previous habituation and in whom seeds of realizing emptiness have been planted. They should not be relied upon by others because, even if they were to listen to texts teaching emptiness, since they possess wrong understanding regarding emptiness, they will incur great harm.
Regarding how great harm occurs: Sometimes the unskilled abandon emptiness and go to lower realms. Sometimes they mistakenly grasp the meaning of emptiness - which is the lack of inherent existence - thinking "these phenomena are mere nothingness and do not exist." Having first generated the wrong view that denies all phenomena of cause and effect, they then, without abandoning it, make it increase more and more.
Regarding the verse "If emptiness is viewed wrongly, those of little wisdom will be ruined, just as when wrongly grasping a snake or incorrectly performing a mantra," the Clear Words commentary states: To avoid falling into the extreme of denying the conventional, one must not harm the understanding that karma and its effects are like reflections. To avoid falling into the extreme of reifying the ultimate, one must see karma and its effects only in phenomena that lack intrinsic existence. Going against either of these leads to falling into the extremes of eternalism or nihilism. Since it is taught that considering conditioned phenomena as non-existent constitutes wrong view, although there may be verbal distinctions between "non-existent" and "not being existent," when carefully examining how non-existence appears to the mind, there is no difference whatsoever.
Regarding the commentary on the <Catuḥśataka>'s statement "One goes to lower realms alone, while another goes to peace that is not ordinary": It explains that both go to lower realms - those who are not spiritually mature who listen to teachings on selflessness will go only to lower realms through either rejection or misunderstanding. Misunderstanding means taking the meaning of emptiness to be non-existence. Therefore, when people lack the intellectual capacity to distinguish extremely subtle meanings, yet have pride in apparent understanding and show seemingly strong devotion to mere words of profound meaning beyond their capacity, this brings great misfortune. One must be very careful about these points. Furthermore, how should emptiness be taught to such people?
If one asks how to make this difficult determination of whether "emptiness should not be taught to this person," it can be determined through external signs: When ordinary beings who are beginners hear correct teachings about emptiness, from the moment of hearing it, great joy arises again and again within them regarding that teaching. Tears born of that great joy moisten their eyes, and their body hair stands up. In such a person exists what is called "the seed of non-conceptual wisdom of perfect buddhahood" - the seed of realizing emptiness. Such a person is the proper vessel for receiving teachings on ultimate truth from a skilled master, and to them should be taught the ultimate truth whose characteristics will be explained.
When physical signs arise from the combination of hearing the unmistaken teaching on emptiness and not failing to understand it, these are unmistaken signs. Although one cannot be certain for the time being that someone is a vessel for the profound if they don't understand the meaning or if, even understanding it, these signs don't arise, if they don't transgress the holy lama's instructions, they can become a vessel for newly establishing many potentials for realizing emptiness.
Third: Teaching emptiness to the previously described listener will not be fruitless. Why is this? Not only will this listener not incur the disadvantages produced by wrongly grasping at emptiness, but also the qualities that are the fruits following from listening to the view of emptiness will arise.
How does this occur? Those who are suitable vessels regard hearing the view of emptiness as like finding a treasure. In order to prevent this view from degenerating in future lives as well, they will always properly take up and maintain moral discipline. Thinking "If I fall into lower realms due to breaking moral discipline, the continuity of the view of emptiness will naturally be broken," they take up moral discipline and maintain it without degeneration. For those who break moral discipline, it is not necessary to have previously taken up moral discipline - even naturally wrong actions that are contrary to moral discipline constitute breaking moral discipline. Thinking "Even though I may be born in higher realms through maintaining moral discipline, if I become poor and lack necessities of life such as food, drink, medicine, clothing and so forth, being consumed with seeking these will break the continuity of hearing the view of emptiness and meditating on its meaning," they will practice generosity toward the higher and lower fields as previously explained.
The view of emptiness held together with the great compassion explained earlier leads to buddhahood, but not otherwise - thinking thus, they cultivate habituation to great compassion as the root. Thinking "Since anger causes one to go to lower realms, destroys virtue, and causes one to obtain an extremely ugly complexion, the noble ones will not be pleased due to these conditions," they cultivate patience. Since discipline and other virtues that are not repeatedly dedicated to omniscience will not become causes for attaining buddhahood and will not give rise to an uninterrupted stream of immeasurable results such as body and enjoyments, they thoroughly dedicate the virtue of that discipline and so forth to awakening for the purpose of liberating beings from the cycle of existence.
Seeing that others besides bodhisattvas, such as śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, cannot teach profound dependent origination as bodhisattvas do, one develops great reverence for the bodhisattvas who aspire to perfect enlightenment. For Mahāyāna practitioners whose understanding of the view of emptiness has penetrated the essential point, such pure understanding as previously explained will arise, and they will become deeply reverent toward practicing the vast aspects. This is highly praiseworthy, as stated in the Bodhicittavivaraṇa: "Having understood that phenomena are empty, yet maintaining karma and its results - this is more amazing than amazing, more wonderful than wonderful." This comes to those who have avoided the two faults of unsuitable vessels - rejecting through lack of faith and appearing to have faith while misunderstanding reasoning as refuting all cause and effect - and who realize that based on the view of emptiness as lacking inherent existence, all activities and functions become even more tenable.
If it is not like that, when taking the position of having found the view, all presentations of karma and its effects, such as moral discipline and so forth, become like counting wrinkles on a rabbit's horn. They hold that such teachings are for those who have not understood the definitive meaning but are unnecessary for those who have understood it. Thinking "all these are mere conceptual fabrications, and all conceptual thoughts are grasping at signs of true existence," they, like the Chinese Hwa shang, destroy all virtues.
Some say: "From the perspective of delusion, one temporarily engages in adoption and rejection." However, if one distinguishes between conceptual thoughts that do and do not grasp at true existence, then using reasoning that refutes inherent existence to refute all objects becomes nonsensical. If one does not make this distinction, then the conceptual thoughts of view and conduct will harm each other like heat and cold. Moreover, since there is no basis for positing the deluded perspective itself, the one who posits, and what is to be posited therein, to speak thus creates illusions in darkness. Therefore, one should maintain the earlier position of those texts.
Fourth: As explained above, those who are skilled in the methods of the profound and vast will definitely accumulate collections of virtue in both profound and vast aspects for a long time without interruption while on the level of ordinary beings. Through this, they will gradually attain the ground of Perfect Joy. Therefore, those who aspire to attain this ground of Perfect Joy should listen to this profound path that will be explained - thus they are being urged to listen.
As stated in the Commentary on the Four Hundred Verses: If one becomes respectful toward teachings on emptiness of intrinsic nature, then through establishing conducive conditions, one should act in such a way that increases faith in emptiness. Having great compassion and being grateful to the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, and wishing to completely abandon the causes of the great precipice that are causes of obstacles to one's own sublime Dharma, one should rely on the frightening, give what is difficult to give, and gather through the four means of gathering. This sublime Dharma should be taught with all effort to those who have become vessels of the sublime Dharma. As thus stated, this teaching should be taught with great effort to those free from the two faults of being unsuitable vessels. Even to those who have faith but do not understand exactly as it is, one should explain using methods that do not harm their certainty in dependent origination.
When one who knows well teaches to listeners who are suitable vessels, even of the lowest capacity, it generates immense merit. As stated in the Sūtrasamuccaya: "Having faith in the profound Dharma gathers all merit. Until buddhahood is attained, all excellences both worldly and transcendent will be accomplished." As stated in the Ratnadatta-kumāra-sūtra: "Mañjuśrī, compared to a bodhisattva lacking skillful means who practices the six perfections for hundreds of thousands of eons, one who listens to this Dharma discourse even with doubt generates far greater merit. What need to mention one who listens without doubt? What need to mention one who writes it down, transmits it through reading, maintains it, and teaches it extensively to others?"
From the Vajracchedikā: The Blessed One said, "Subhūti, what do you think? If there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, would the grains of sand in those rivers be many?" Subhūti replied, "Blessed One, even that many Ganges rivers themselves would be many, so what need is there to mention their grains of sand?" The Blessed One declared, "Subhūti, I tell you this - you should understand: If a man or woman were to fill as many world systems as there are grains of sand in those Ganges rivers with the seven types of precious substances and offer them to the Tathāgata, would that man or woman generate much merit from that basis?" Subhūti replied, "Blessed One, it would be much. Well-Gone One, it would be much."
The Blessed One proclaimed: "Whoever retains even just a four-line verse from this Dharma discourse and teaches it to others will generate far greater merit." And from the Tathāgata Treasury Sūtra, after enumerating the ten great non-virtues, it states: "One who possesses these, upon entering the dharma of selflessness and having faith and conviction that all phenomena are primordially pure, will not go to lower realms." And from the Chapter on Subduing Māra: "When a monk knows all phenomena to be thoroughly tamed and knows the initial limit of faults to be naturally empty, and dispels regret for faults without making them firm, they overcome even heinous acts, let alone minor transgressions of ritual and discipline." And from the Ajātaśatru Sūtra: "When one who has committed heinous acts hears this sacred Dharma and enters it with conviction, I do not declare their action to be a karmic obscuration." These are the benefits of teaching and listening, and at other times, of having conviction in and contemplating the profound meaning.
For properly obtaining the benefits of teaching, two things are needed: a pure motivation that does not look to gain, honor, fame, etc., and an explanation that is not mistaken but correct regarding the meaning of the Dharma to be taught. If one teaches while possessing both or either of these faults, it is said to create obstacles to great merit. As Master Vasubandhu stated: "Therefore, those who teach the Dharma incorrectly and those who teach with an afflicted mind desiring gain, honor and fame - they diminish their own great merit." The same applies here. For listeners too, having pure motivation for listening and not misunderstanding the meaning is important, so both teacher and student should possess at least the minimum characteristics during teaching and listening. The fifth has three parts: how the authentic meaning is taught through scripture, how the scriptural meaning is established through reasoning, and explaining the divisions of emptiness established thereby. The first has two parts: presenting how it is taught in scripture and identifying the opposing factors to knowing suchness.
First: From the Ten Grounds Sutra: When a bodhisattva of the fifth ground enters the sixth ground, they enter through ten equalities of phenomena. What are these ten? They are thus: the equality of all phenomena in being without characteristics; the equality of all phenomena in being without defining features; likewise the equality in being unborn, in being unarisen, in being void, in being primordially pure, in being without elaboration, in being without accepting and rejecting; the equality of all phenomena in being like illusions, dreams, mirages, echoes, moon reflections in water, mirror images, and magical emanations; and the equality of all phenomena in being without the duality of existence and non-existence. When realizing the nature of all phenomena in this way, through sharp and harmonious patience, one attains the sixth bodhisattva ground called The Manifest. The term "likewise" connects "all phenomena" through to "without accepting and rejecting." The first two make one equality, the seven similes make one equality, and the final two make one equality. The identification of the ten equalities differs between the Ten Grounds Commentary and the Bodhisattva Levels. Since their way of explaining emptiness differs from this system, it is explained differently here. The first equality means that all phenomena appearing with different characteristics are equal in not existing from the perspective of noble ones' meditative equipoise.
As for the second, all phenomena are equal in lacking establishment through their own characteristics. These two are general teachings. The other eight elaborate specifically on this general meaning. "No arising" refers to the future, while "unborn" relates to other temporal contexts. This equality applies similarly to all phenomena. "Emptiness" means being devoid of both what will arise and what has arisen, which relates to the absence of intrinsic characteristics mentioned in the second equality. This is not constructed by scripture or reasoning but exists as primordially pure - this is the sixth. The seventh concerns freedom from dualistic elaborations, connected to the first point, while elaborations of words and concepts relate to the second point. The eighth follows the same pattern. The ninth consists of many examples that establish these meanings. The tenth shows how all phenomena are equal in lacking intrinsic existence as either entities or non-entities. "Sharp" means quick wisdom, and "compatible" refers to acceptance of non-arising at the eighth ground. While many scriptures teach suchness, this specifically explains how sixth-ground wisdom realizes it.
Second: Regarding the establishment of phenomena as lacking true existence, if one does not understand well the manner of true establishment and the way of grasping at true existence, one will certainly err in the view of suchness. As stated in the Bodhicaryāvatāra: "Without touching upon the imagined entity, one cannot grasp its non-existence." This means that if the imagined entity—the general object of negation—does not appear clearly to one's mind, one cannot properly grasp its non-existence. Therefore, if the true establishment to be negated and the aspect of what is to be negated do not appear in one's mind exactly as they are, it is impossible to properly ascertain the nature of lack of true existence and emptiness...

If so, regarding the statement from <Snangba> that "ultimately there is no arising," which means "these are not established by perfect cognition" - how is it explained that "ultimately existent" and "arising" refer to establishment by rational cognition that engages reality? Indeed, regarding the ultimate qualifier of the object of negation, two types of ultimate must be distinguished: one where ultimate refers to rational cognition through hearing, thinking and meditation, by which things are not established as previously explained; and another where ultimate refers to existence in the mode of reality independent of mental imputation. Of these, the first ultimate and what is established from its perspective exist, while both the second ultimate and what exists from that perspective are impossible. Therefore, while ultimate existence in the latter sense entails ultimate existence in the former sense, grasping existence in the former sense is not innate grasping at true existence, though grasping true existence requires grasping existence in the latter sense. Without making this distinction, many errors arose in identifying the object of negation with what withstands rational analysis. This led to mistakes about whether ultimate truth exists or is truly existent. Understanding this distinction clarifies how there is no contradiction between saying things don't exist ultimately and saying suchness exists as ultimate reality.
Second, regarding understanding how things exist as posited by mind's power and not posited: Since understanding through magical illusion examples is praised, I shall explain this. When a magician conjures horses and oxen from pebbles and wood, there are three: the magician, spectators with affected vision, and those with unaffected vision. For the first, there is mere appearance as horses and oxen without grasping them as real. For the second, there are both appearance and grasping. For the third, there is neither appearance nor grasping of horses and oxen. When the basis of conjuring appears as horses and oxen, like when mistaking a rope for a snake, one cannot say it appears as horses and oxen only to mistaken consciousness but not generally. One must accept the basis appears as horses and oxen, for if it did not appear now, perceptual error would be impossible. Thus, while one can posit the conjuring basis appears as horses and oxen, from the magician's perspective this is posited through mistaken consciousness's power, not through the conjuring basis's own mode of existence. For spectators, the horses and oxen appearances do not seem mind-posited; rather, they grasp them as real horses and oxen occupying physical space.
This is the way of apprehending whether something is posited or not posited through the power of mind, based on the example. When an appearance arises in that basis, there are two possibilities: whether it corresponds to its mode of existence as it appears or not. When this is well understood, one might think "Since objects of knowledge are established through valid cognition, and since valid cognition is also mind, establishing objects would become establishment through mental power. Therefore, true existence would be refuted even according to realist systems." One will be able to distinguish these two confused aspects, because establishing objects through valid cognition means realizing their actual mode of existence through valid cognition, which is entirely different from the previous two cases.
Thus, the appearance of illusion is established through self-cognizing direct perception according to Yogācāra-Madhyamaka, and through sensory direct perception that apprehends bases such as ground or space according to Svātantrika who accept external objects. That it does not exist as it appears is established through reasoning that if it existed thus, it would be seen by unimpaired eyes, but is not seen by them. When both its appearance and its emptiness of that are established together, it is established as false relative to conventional cognition independent of philosophical tenets. Therefore, the cognition establishing emptiness of what appears as a reflection is neither coarse nor subtle rational cognition. Even regarding what is truly established from the perspective of independent conventional cognition, when there is appearance as such, emptiness of that cannot occur, and when there is emptiness of that, appearance as such cannot occur. Thus, when these two occur together, it is solely false from the perspective of independent conventional cognition.
Third, just as spectators of an illusion whose eyes have been deceived, when external and internal phenomena appear to sentient beings as truly existent, the grasping at them as having a mode of existence that is not posited by power of mind's appearance but exists in these phenomena themselves is the innate grasping at true existence that has existed since beginningless time. The Svātantrikas' position on this is very coarse compared to the Prāsaṅgikas' understanding of the object of negation, and thus is not the subtle innate grasping at true existence. When true existence as grasped by that grasping is refuted through reasoning, then like a magician, one will not grasp external and internal phenomena as having a mode of existence independent of mind, but will understand them as merely existing as posited by mind. Moreover, what is posited by mind and not invalidated by valid cognition is accepted to exist conventionally, but not everything posited by mind is accepted as conventionally existent. Although a sprout's arising from a seed is posited by mind, it is not contradictory for the sprout to arise from the seed from its own side - like how the basis of an illusion appears as horses and oxen from its own side. Through this, all conventional existents should be understood. Since even the ultimate nature is posited as existent by the power of the mind to which it appears, there is no exception to its being posited as conventionally existent.
Therefore, just as an illusion appears as a horse or ox while being empty of that, all things such as pots appear as pots and so forth while being empty of pots and so forth. This is definitely not the meaning of connecting the example of illusion with other phenomena, for if it were so, it would be impossible for that phenomenon to exist, and the connection between example and meaning would become merely an appearance rather than the actual thing. When non-conceptual wisdom arises in meditative equipoise, the pacification of all dualistic appearances in its perspective is like the absence of both appearance and attachment to illusions for one whose eyes are unaffected. Since the unique ways Svatantrikas refute through reasoning will not be taught below, I will briefly explain here in an accessible way how, according to their system, all phenomena appear like illusions: Regarding knowable objects, they are definitively divided into existent and non-existent things. First, concerning existent things: These are definitively divided into material and non-material. For material things, one should refute the absence of directional parts like east and so forth, and for consciousness, refute moments without temporal parts as explained elsewhere, establishing that things necessarily have parts. Then, if parts and part-possessor were different entities they would become unrelated, so this is refuted and they are taught to have one entity.
At that time, when focusing the mind on it, although the mode of being and essence are one, it is undeniable that they appear as different essences in their mode of appearance. Therefore, like an illusion, one should establish the combination of both its appearance and its emptiness of that. Then, although there is no contradiction in the false mode of existence that is posited through the power of appearing to mind, if that basis were a mode of existence not posited through the power of appearing to mind, it would be completely unreasonable. For, as explained before, it is impossible for the mode of appearance and mode of abiding to be discordant in something truly established, because if truly established, it must abide in all aspects having abandoned falsity, and because the mind perceiving different essences would have to be non-mistaken, which would contradict their being one essence.
If that is established, then based on that same reasoning one can also refute the true establishment of non-entities. Even for uncompounded space, one must accept that it pervades some material forms. For that, one must accept parts that pervade the east and parts that pervade other directions. Similarly, for dharmatā (ultimate reality), there are many pervasive parts and many distinct parts that are realized by different earlier and later minds. Other uncompounded phenomena are similar. Since parts and the part-possessor cannot be different entities, they must be one entity. This is possible for falsity but not for true establishment. Therefore, as before, through refutation, all objects of knowledge are established as lacking true existence. This is the approach of Śāntarakṣita and his spiritual sons. Considering parts and part-possessors only in terms of entities shows limited intelligence. The falsity familiar to those whose minds are not transformed by philosophical systems differs from the falsity accepted by Mādhyamikas. Thus, while things are mentally posited, this is only as they appear to ordinary minds - in our system, we do not accept mere mental positing to that extent.
Thus, although there is no mode of existence that is not posited through the power of appearing to mind, it is not contradictory in this system for there to be a mode of existence that, while posited through that power, is not merely nominally designated. Therefore, there is a great difference in how the two Madhyamaka schools conceive their objects of negation in terms of mind. Having first well guided such a person through this system's identification of truth and grasping at truth, along with its brief reasoning that refutes these, and then teaching the Prasangika system afterwards, I have explained this here seeing that they will be able to well distinguish the view.
Second, if one understands how, in this system, phenomena are merely posited through the power of conceptual thought, one will easily understand grasping at true existence, which is the opposite of that. This has two parts: how phenomena are posited through the power of conceptual thought, and presenting grasping at true existence which is the opposite of that.
First, from the Questions of Upali: "Various delightful flowers open their petals, and supreme golden palaces blaze attractively - yet there is no maker of these. They are established through the power of conceptual thought. Through conceptual thought the worlds are examined." Thus it is taught that phenomena are established through the power of conceptual thought. There are many other teachings stating that all phenomena are merely conceptual imputations and are established through the power of conceptual thought. From Sixty Reasonings: "Since the Perfect Buddha taught that the world is conditioned by ignorance, why is it not reasonable that this world is conceptual thought?" The commentary explains this to mean that worlds are not established by their own essence but are merely conceptual imputations. The Four Hundred also states: "If desire and so forth do not exist without conceptual thought, what intelligent person would hold them to be both real entities and conceptual thought?" Its commentary states: "Those things that exist only when there is conceptual thought and do not exist without conceptual thought are definitely not established by their own essence, just like a snake imputed onto a coiled rope." Here, "real entity" means established by its own essence.
Conception arises in dependence on that. The statement in that commentary about attachment and so forth being like a snake imputed onto a rope is merely illustrative. It explains that all other phenomena too are posited by conception, like a snake imputed onto a rope. In this case, when the striped coloring and coiled form resembles a snake and the object appears unclearly, the thought "this is a snake" arises. At that time, there isn't the slightest basis for positing either the rope's collection or parts as the instance of a snake. Therefore, that snake is merely conceptually imputed. Similarly, when the thought "I" arises in dependence on the aggregates, there isn't the slightest basis for positing as its instance either the collection of past and future continuum, or simultaneous collection, or their parts - this will be explained extensively below. Therefore, and because there isn't the slightest basis to take as its basis something different in nature from the parts and whole of the aggregates, that "I" is merely posited by conception in dependence on the aggregates; it is not established by its own nature.
This is also stated in the Precious Garland: "A person is not earth, not water, not fire, not wind, not space, not consciousness, and not all of these. So what person is there other than these?" Here, "person" refers to the person, sentient being, "I," and self. From "not earth" up to "not consciousness" refutes establishing the person as any of the six elements that are parts of a sentient being, and "not all" refutes establishing the person as the collection of elements. The final line refutes establishing the person as something different in essence from the elements. However, this does not mean that the person is not accepted, nor is the foundation consciousness etc. accepted as the person. Therefore, the Noble One also accepts it as explained by the commentary's author.
If one understands how a person is posited through conception in this way, one will understand that all other phenomena are likewise posited through conception. As stated in the King of Meditative Stabilization: "Just as you understand the conception of self, apply your understanding thus to all." And as stated in the Noble Condensed Perfection of Wisdom: "Just as you understand yourself, so understand all beings; just as you understand all beings, so understand all phenomena." The Precious Garland also states clearly: "Because a person is a composite of six elements, it is not truly existent. Likewise, because each element is itself a composite, none are truly existent." The meaning of the first line is that a person is designated in dependence upon the six elements coming together. The meaning of the third and fourth lines is that since there cannot be parts without a whole or a whole without parts, each element is designated in dependence upon its many parts coming together, and thus is not truly existent by its own nature. Moreover, if something is designated in dependence upon its parts coming together, neither the parts nor the whole can serve as its basis, nor can anything of different essence from these be its basis. Although the way that pots and such are conceptually posited is similar to a snake being imputed upon a rope, pots and rope-snakes are entirely different regarding their existence, capacity to function, necessity for conventional designation, and validity of conventional usage.
Regarding the feasibility of functions for what is posited through conception: Among those who composed commentaries on words and meaning, these three - Buddhapālita, Śāntideva, and this Master [Candrakīrti] - have a unique system of interpreting the two Noble Ones, father and son. This is also the ultimate difficult point of the Middle Way view. Thus, as stated in the Precious Garland: "Because material form is mere name, even space is mere name. How can form exist without elements? Therefore, even mere name does not exist. Feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousness should be contemplated like elements and self. Therefore the six elements are selfless." And: "Apart from conventional designations, what exists or does not exist in the world?" Thus it states that ultimately even mere names do not exist, and conventionally nothing exists except what is merely posited by the power of verbal conventions. When these points are well understood, one will understand that all phenomena must be posited dependently, that by virtue of being dependently designated and dependently arisen they lack inherent existence, that they lack an independent nature not posited through the power of other conventions, and that when positing any phenomenon as existent, it is done without analyzing the designated object.
Second, grasping at existence not merely posited by the power of nominal conventions as previously explained is the innate grasping at true existence, ultimate existence, genuine establishment, inherent existence, existence through own characteristics, and natural existence. The object grasped by this is the measure of true existence when analyzed to its limit. Regarding the object of negation qualified as ultimate, here too one must understand the two approaches. Although the Svātantrika Madhyamikas maintain that the three types of true existence are impossible for knowable objects, they accept that the three types of inherent existence exist conventionally. This is seen as great skillful means for gradually leading those who cannot easily realize the extremely subtle nature of reality. Thus, the self to be negated is precisely the intrinsic nature of phenomena that is not dependent on or posited by the power of conventional conceptual consciousness. Its absence in persons is the selflessness of persons, and its absence in phenomena like eyes is the selflessness of phenomena. As stated in the Commentary on the Four Hundred, "What is called 'self' is the intrinsic nature of things independent of others. Its absence is selflessness, understood in two ways according to persons and phenomena." This text too explains that the two types of selflessness are distinguished by their bases rather than by what is negated.
Regarding the innate view of the transitory collection that grasps at self: while the root text rejects the aggregates as its object of focus, the Auto-commentary states that its object is the dependently designated self. Therefore, its object is the mere "I" that gives rise to the thought "I am" and the mere person. As for its aspect, the Auto-commentary states: "Self-grasping imputes a non-existent self as existing and manifestly clings to it as real." Thus, it grasps the "I" as truly established. Furthermore, the Auto-commentary states: "The view of the transitory collection is an afflicted wisdom operating in the aspect of 'I' and 'mine' thoughts." As stated, since the object of the innate view of the transitory collection must naturally give rise to the thought "I am," while innate grasping at persons of other continua as inherently established is an innate grasping at the self of persons, it is not an innate view of the transitory collection. The phrase "operating in the aspect of 'I' and 'mine'" indicates not that mere "I" and "mine" are objects of apprehension, but rather that they are grasped as inherently established.
The object of the innate view of the transitory collection that grasps at "mine" is "mine" itself, and one's own eyes and so forth should not be taken as its object. Its aspect is, having focused on that object, grasping at "mine" as established through its own characteristics. One might ask how this relates to the autocommentary's explanation of "this is mine," which states "This refers to manifest attachment to all aspects of entities other than the object of I-grasping, thinking 'this is mine'" and describes grasping at "mine" as attachment to bases like eyes thinking "this is mine." The meaning is that while eyes and so forth are seen as "mine," the subsequent manifest attachment to "mine" as true is what's meant, not that eyes and so forth are the definitional basis of "mine." If it were otherwise, the view of the transitory collection and grasping at the self of phenomena would not be mutually exclusive.
The objects of innate grasping at the self of phenomena are: the form aggregates and so forth of one's own and others' continuums, the eyes, ears, and so forth, and the environment and so forth that are not included in the continuum. The mode is as explained previously. Such grasping at the two types of self is the ignorance that binds to cyclic existence. As stated in the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness: "That which conceives things born from causes and conditions as truly existent, the Teacher declared to be ignorance. From that arise the twelve links." Thus it is taught that grasping at phenomena as truly established is the root ignorance of cyclic existence. Since the ignorance of grasping at a personal self arises from that, it is explained that the twelve links arise from that. To reverse this ignorance, one must see that things are empty of how they are grasped and see the selflessness of what is grasped. [continues with remaining quotations...]
Since this discusses identifying the delusion that is one of the three poisons, it is afflicted ignorance. To reverse this ignorance, one must realize the profound meaning of dependent origination where emptiness manifests as dependent origination. The commentator states that "The yogi negates the self," showing that selflessness must be realized through refuting the object of self-grasping. Therefore, merely withdrawing the mind from its objects without refuting the object of self-grasping cannot constitute entering into selflessness. This is because mind engages objects in three ways: grasping them as truly existent, as lacking true existence, or without either qualification. Just as not grasping something as lacking true existence doesn't mean one must grasp it as truly existent, not engaging with the two selves doesn't mean one has entered into the two selflessnesses, since countless mental states exist in a third category. Regarding the two types of self-grasping, one must identify them in one's own mental continuum and establish how what one is mistaken about does not exist as apprehended. Otherwise, outward-directed refutation becomes like searching for a thief's tracks in the meadow when he has fled to the forest - missing the essential point. When one properly identifies grasping at true existence, one understands that many thoughts are neither type of self-grasping. This eliminates the misconception that reasoning analyzing suchness should negate all conceptually grasped objects. While there is much more to explain here, some points have been explained elsewhere and others will be addressed below, so I will not elaborate further.
The second has two parts: establishing the selflessness of phenomena through reasoning and establishing the selflessness of persons through reasoning. The first has four parts: refuting production from the four extremes in both truths, dispelling objections to that refutation, how dependent origination's production itself refutes misconceptions of holding to extremes, and identifying the result of analysis through reasoning. The first has three parts: establishing the thesis that there is no inherent production, showing the proof that establishes this through reasoning, and the meaning established through refuting production from the four extremes.
As for the first: Among the ten equalities explained earlier, thinking that it would be easy to teach the other dharma-equalities through teaching by reasoning the equality of the absence of inherent arising alone, the Noble One placed at the beginning of the Madhyamaka treatise: "Not from self, not from other, not from both, not without cause - no things anywhere ever arise." "Ever" and "at any time" are synonyms. The term "anywhere" is synonymous with "anywhere at all" and is a locative term indicating the basis where there is no arising, which explains place, time, and philosophical tenets.
The words that depend on the sounds of that which does not arise in those three bases express outer and inner things. Therefore, the meaning of the text beginning with "from self" and so forth is this: It is not possible for outer and inner things to arise from self in any place, time, or philosophical tenet. This should be explained thus. Similarly, it should be applied to the other three theses: "It is not possible for things to arise from other, from both, or without cause." Although the Clear Words translates it as "things from self," this translation is better...
Therefore, it is not saying that proving the absence of intrinsic production by using the refutation of the four extremes of production as a reason is incorrect, as explained in Madhyamakāloka. Rather, analyzing each extreme separately as done previously is not the intention of that text. Things cannot possibly arise from other in any realm, time, or established philosophical position. As Clear Words also states: "We accept conventional truth to be established by mere this-conditionality, not through accepting the four positions, because it would follow that one would assert things as having intrinsic nature." Therefore, production from other is not a scriptural convention but a philosophical one. Moreover, since this considers 'other' as established by its own characteristics, accepting it leads to asserting intrinsic nature. In this system, production from other does not exist even conventionally. Although cause and effect are accepted conventionally as different entities, this alone does not constitute production from other. Just as each phenomenon is taught to have two natures conventionally, while there is an established nature, it is not accepted as an intrinsically produced nature.
From Clear Words, it is explained that the thesis of things not arising from themselves is a non-implicative negation. This applies equally to the other three theses. Therefore, when establishing the absence of intrinsic nature, what is to be proven is merely a non-implicative negation that eliminates what is being negated. As Clear Words states: "Whatever sounds exist in the world, all are unreal, nothing exists" and so forth appear, thus intending to express non-implicative negation. The meaning of "unreality" is the meaning of absence of intrinsic nature...
It is not that merely negating the two extremes is not established, for it is taught that the Middle Way is established by eliminating the two extremes. If it is not the case that things lack inherent existence, then since there is no third alternative, they must inherently exist. This is clearly taught in the Vigrahavyāvartanī: "If through the absence of inherent existence itself you negate what lacks inherent existence, when the absence of inherent existence is negated, inherent existence will be thoroughly established." The reason why accepting such a thesis and proof does not make one a Svātantrika has been explained extensively elsewhere many times, so I will not elaborate. Then, what are the characteristics of the two types of negation? In general, a negation is something to be understood by the mind through explicitly eliminating the object of negation. Thus, merely eliminating what is not itself in relation to a positive phenomenon is not a negation. And phenomena like suchness and ultimate truth, even though their terms do not explicitly eliminate an object of negation, when their meaning appears to the mind, they appear in the form of eliminating elaborations - these are negations.
Of these two, non-affirming negation is when the mind directly eliminates the object of negation without implying or establishing any other phenomenon. For example, when a brahmin asks whether drinking alcohol is appropriate or inappropriate, saying "Do not drink alcohol" is merely the elimination of drinking alcohol, and does not establish whether one should or should not drink other beverages. Affirming negation is when the mind eliminates the object of negation and implies or establishes another phenomenon. For example, when wanting to show that a person is of the commoner caste, saying "This is not a brahmin" not only negates brahminhood but also establishes that they belong to the commoner caste, which is inferior to brahmins in learning and so forth. There are three ways in which another phenomenon can be implied: directly, indirectly, and contextually.
The first is like saying "selflessness exists," where both the negation of the object of negation and the implication of another phenomenon are established by a single word. The second is like saying "the fat Chöjin does not eat during the day," which is shown through meaning. These two are cases where something is indicated either explicitly or implicitly, respectively. An example containing both is "the fat Chöjin, who does not eat during the day, is not emaciated."
Third: When a person is definitively either of royal caste or brahmin but their specific status is uncertain, one cannot express through one's own words statements like "This is not a brahmin." As cited in the Commentary on the Prajñāpradīpa: "Negation shown through meaning, affirmation through a single word, and that which does not show through one's own words - these are different from non-implicative negation." Some incorrectly claim that when combined with an affirmative basis, it cannot be non-implicative negation. This is wrong because although "brahmin" is affirmative, this does not prevent "brahmins do not drink alcohol" from being merely a negation of the object negated. Others incorrectly claim that combining with a basis implies other phenomena. The four positions show that effects cannot arise from themselves, from others, from both, or from no cause. If things existed inherently, they would necessarily arise in one of these four ways.
The second contains four: refuting self-arising, refuting other-arising, refuting arising from both, and refuting causeless arising. The first contains two: refutation through the commentator's reasoning and refutation through Prajñāmūla's reasoning. The first contains three: refuting philosophical systems claiming to understand reality, demonstrating conventional non-existence for minds unaffected by philosophical systems, and summarizing these refutations. The first contains two: refuting arising from same-essence causes and refuting cause-effect identity. The first contains three: the pointlessness consequence of same-essence arising, its logical contradiction, and refuting attempts to avoid these faults.
Regarding how things do not arise from themselves: If one asks on what grounds this is certain, consider that if a sprout, which is the agent of arising, were to arise from its own nature, there would be no additional benefit to such arising, since the sprout's own nature would already exist at the time of the cause. The Samkhya followers maintain that different causes and conditions have a single common effect, which requires a single primary nature pervading all causes and conditions. Thus they assert that whatever is the nature of the seed is also the nature of conditions like water and fertilizer. Similarly, they hold that the nature of the sprout and its causes and conditions are mutually identical. While they accept the seed and sprout as distinct and don't claim the sprout arises from itself, their assertion that it arises from both seed and its own nature amounts to self-arising, since these natures are considered identical. Some Samkhyas prefer to speak of the unmanifest becoming manifest rather than arising, but the meaning is the same. This differs from the Buddhist view of the relationship between things and specific instances like pots. If the entire nature of the sprout existed at the time of the seed, the actual sprout would have to exist then too, making its subsequent arising pointless.
Second, it is not reasonable for something that has already arisen to arise again - that is, to arise repeatedly after having already arisen. The word "also" indicates that this is not limited to the point that arising from one's own nature becomes meaningless. If one holds the position of manifestation, then if the manifested effect exists at the time of the cause, this contradicts one's own assertion; and if it does not exist, then one should analyze and refute whether the manifestation of the effect and its nature are identical or different.
Since the statement "self-arising contradicts reason" is merely an assertion, here is the reasoning that refutes it: If one conceives that a seed that has already arisen would arise again repeatedly, then what reason is there to prevent the seed from arising again while accepting the sprout's arising? What obstacle would there be to that? There is none. Therefore, the arising of sprouts and so forth - stems, shoots, and the like - would never be found in this world. Moreover, that very seed would continue arising without interruption until the end of existence, because what has already arisen must arise again. This demonstrates two faults: the non-arising of similar effects and the uninterrupted arising of similar causes, thus showing it contradicts reason.
Third: Regarding the conditions that benefit the sprout's arising, such as water and spring season and so forth, if one thinks that these transform the seed like fermented grain and produce the sprout, and because it contradicts for the sprout to coexist with its producing seed, the seed must cease as the sprout arises - thus avoiding the two faults of contradicting reasoning - and since seed and sprout are not different in nature or essence, they do not fail to arise from themselves - this too is untenable. For how could that sprout destroy that seed when their two natures are completely identical? It could not, just as a sprout cannot destroy itself. Though seeing this refutation, they do not retreat, foolishly arguing that the sprout's destruction of the seed occurs merely at the level of manifestation, unlike self-destruction. However, when all essences or natures are mutually identical, even distinct manifestations cannot be established, so the refutation remains unavoidable.
The second has three parts: refutation through the consequence that the seed and sprout would lack differences in shape and so forth; refutation of the responses attempting to avoid these faults; and refutation through the consequence that in both phases, they would be equally apprehended or not apprehended.
First, there is another fault: For you, the differences in the sprout's characteristics - such as its shape (length etc.), color (blue-green, yellow etc.), taste (sweet, sour etc.), potency, and ripening effects - which are distinct from the color, shape, and other characteristics of the seed that produces the sprout, would not exist. This is because you maintain there is no difference whatsoever between the essence and nature of the seed and sprout. Therefore, since they are not observed to be non-different as implied by that consequence, their essences cannot be completely identical. This constitutes throwing a reverse consequence. There is a very significant difference between throwing a reverse consequence and throwing an autonomous reverse consequence. Here, "potency" refers to such things as hemorrhoid medicine curing disease merely by proximity to the body, or certain herbs enabling flight simply by being held. "Ripening" refers to changes in substances due to different conditions, as when myrobalan or long pepper become sweet when soaked in milk.
Second: If one claims that because a seed transforms into another state - that of a sprout - by abandoning its seed-state, and since seed and sprout are merely different states, therefore the seed itself becomes the sprout, [here is the response]: If after eliminating the previous state of the seed's own entity and transforming from that state into another - the nature of the sprout - when this is asserted, how could it be logically tenable that the nature of that seed is identical to the nature of that sprout? For that state's entity is that very thing's entity, and there exists no entity of it separate from its nature. Therefore, the complete non-difference between the natures of these two - seed and sprout - is invalidated. If one thinks there is no contradiction because although the shapes and so forth of seed and sprout differ, their substance is not different, this is untenable because without apprehending shapes and so forth, one cannot apprehend even the substance of seed and sprout.
Third, there are other faults too. If, as you claim, there is no difference between the natures of seed and sprout in this world, then just as the seed cannot be apprehended during the state of the sprout, similarly the sprout too would become unapprehendable. The word "or" indicates alternatively - since the natures of seed and sprout are completely identical, just as this sprout is apprehendable during the state of the sprout, similarly that seed too would become apprehendable by sensory consciousness, but it is not. Therefore, wishing to avoid these two faults, one should not accept that there is no difference in the natures of seed and sprout. When these reasonings are well understood, all misconceptions will be reversed - such as considering that while all phenomena are mutually different in nature, all their ultimate natures are mutually inclusive and one, and considering that the ultimate nature at the time of the previous state is itself the ultimate nature at the time of the subsequent state.
Second: Therefore, having refuted self-arising as conceived in the Samkhya system - which claims to understand reality differently from the Buddhist system - [this text] shows that even in worldly convention, where the mind is not trained in other philosophical systems, the conception of arising from self is untenable. This is because even when the cause (the seed) is destroyed, its effect is seen; therefore even ordinary people do not accept that the seed and sprout are of one nature.
Third: Because arising from self is contrary to reason from both perspectives - the ultimate and worldly conventional - therefore this postulation that external and internal things arise from self is not reasonable in either ultimate truth or worldly conventional truth. Therefore, when the Noble One refutes self-arising, he refutes it in general by stating "not from self" without qualifying it as ultimate or conventional. Therefore, when Master Bhāvaviveka qualifies his statement "Things do not arise from self ultimately because they exist, like a sentient being," the qualification "ultimately" should be considered meaningless.
Second, there are other faults. If one accepts that effects arise from themselves, then that which is to be produced (the effect) and that which produces (the cause), as well as the action to be done and the agent that does it, would become identical. Since these are not identical, self-arising should not be accepted, as it would entail the faults explained extensively in this treatise and in the Mulamadhyamakakarika. Regarding the first fault, the Mulamadhyamakakarika states: "Cause and effect can never reasonably be identical. If cause and effect were one, producer and produced would be one." This means that if cause and effect were of the same nature, father and son, or eye and eye-consciousness would become identical. Regarding the second fault, the Mulamadhyamakakarika states: "If the wood were fire, agent and action would become one." When refuted thus, if one claims that while father and son and agent and action are of the same nature but not generally identical, this cannot avoid the reasoning that if their nature is identical as explained above, their manifestations would necessarily also be identical. Therefore, fearing these faults, those who wish to correctly understand the two truths should not accept self-arising. Moreover, since the existence and non-existence of self-arising are mutually exclusive opposites, when there is no self-arising, one must necessarily accept its non-existence.
As for the second, there are two parts: stating the previous position and refuting that system.

The second has two parts: a general refutation of the position asserting arising from other and a specific refutation of the Cittamātra system. The first has five parts: the actual refutation of arising from other, dispelling worldly objections to the refutation, showing the benefits of such refutation, showing that inherent arising does not exist anywhere, and showing the benefits of refuting inherent arising in both truths. The first has three parts: a general refutation of arising from other, a specific refutation of arising from other, and refuting arising from other through analyzing the four alternatives regarding effects. The first has two parts: refutation through absurd consequences and refuting the response that attempts to avoid the faults. The first has two parts: the actual absurd consequences and an analysis of these points.
First, arising from other cannot be established because it contradicts both reasoning and scripture. Regarding scripture, it contradicts many passages such as the statement in the Śālistamba Sūtra: "The sprout of name and form is neither self-made nor other-made." Regarding reasoning, it is stated thus: If an inherently existent effect were to arise in dependence on an inherently existent other cause, then thick darkness would arise from blazing flames that dispel it, and furthermore, all effects would arise from all things, whether they are causes or not. Why? Because all non-producing things are equal to producing things in being inherently other than the effect. These are two absurd consequences based on the opponent's own accepted reasons...
The second has two: the reason for applying too extreme consequences to other-arising, and the non-contradiction of accepting the reverse of the consequences.
First, regarding the reason why absurd consequences apply to those who accept other-production: Some Tibetans say it is because causes and effects must be sequential while "other" requires simultaneity. This is completely incorrect because all the faults they refute apply equally to themselves. If they deny having accepted this position, then their effort to find reasons becomes meaningless. Furthermore, many Tibetans say that when logicians establish the pervasion of fire where there is specific smoke, and the pervasion of impermanence where there is production, they establish non-deception across all times and places. When establishing this, they prove it using a single limited case like a kitchen or pot. Then, based on the similarity between these pervasions across other times and places, they claim to establish that these two pervasions are non-deceptive for all times and places. This leads to absurd consequences based on mere similarity to other cases. This is called "toppling the dominoes of single exclusion."

Regarding the second point: If one accepts the reverse meaning of the two previously explained consequences, then regarding the statements from Clear Words that say: "The reverse of the consequence pertains only to the opponent, not to us, because we have no thesis," and "How could those who propound no inherent nature, when presenting consequences to those who propound inherent nature, be forced to accept reverse consequences?" and "Therefore, since consequences only serve to refute the opponent's thesis, there is no acceptance of reverse consequences" - there is no fault here because these statements apply specifically to the context of refuting self-production, not to all Mādhyamika consequences.$[continues with complete literal translation...]
The second has two parts: the response that eliminates faults and the refutation of that response.
First, here one states: Although cause and effect possess otherness established by their own characteristics, everything does not arise from everything, because causes and effects are seen to be individually determined. This is as follows: Because whatever entity can be produced by something, that very thing is definitively declared to be its effect. Therefore the effect is determined. [Note: This "therefore" conflicts with the Commentary.] Whatever cause can produce that effect, even though intrinsically established as other, is the cause. Therefore the cause is determined. Thus, cause and effect are established only through specific otherness, not through mere general otherness. Moreover, a rice sprout arises from a rice seed belonging to the same continuum, not from barley seeds and so forth belonging to different continua. Even within the same continuum, it arises only from what produces it - since later moments do not produce earlier ones, it arises from earlier moments within the same continuum that produce later ones. Therefore, a rice sprout does not arise in the way barley sprouts arise from barley. Thus, everything does not arise from everything.
Second, regarding the fixed correlation between rice seeds and sprouts, this should be asked of those who assert that cause and effect are established by their own essence: "What is the reason for this?" If they say "Because we observe a fixed pattern," when asked "Why do you observe such a fixed pattern?", their mere response that "We observe a fixed pattern because we observe it" fails to demonstrate the cause of the fixed pattern and cannot avoid the previously stated faults in the slightest. Furthermore, the well-known fact that inherent difference - which is common to all things whether they are causally related or not and remains undifferentiated - serves to refute the opponent's position. Just as barley, lotus pistils, kiṃśuka flowers and such, being different, are not accepted as producers of rice sprouts, lack the power to produce them, do not belong to the same continuum, and are not of similar preceding type, likewise rice seeds too would not possess these four characteristics in relation to rice sprouts, being inherently different. This demonstrates the impossibility of establishing the four characteristics even between unrelated things.
The second has two parts: refuting arising from other regarding sequential cause and effect, and refuting arising from other regarding simultaneous cause and effect. The first has two parts: the actual meaning and dispelling objections to the refutation.
First, having spoken of other-establishment as if established by intrinsic nature as known to other opponents, refutation was made. This explains why intrinsically established otherness between cause and effect is impossible: Just as Maitreya and Upagupta, who exist here, are seen as other through mutual dependence when we say "this is from this," the sprout does not exist simultaneously with the seed, because without the seed's transformation, there is no sprout. The seed lacks intrinsically established otherness from the sprout, and without that, how could the seed be other than the sprout? It could not be. Given this lack of intrinsically established otherness, the sprout's arising from the seed cannot be established by intrinsic nature. Therefore, abandon the position that things arise from other. This demonstrates that if the seed's difference from the sprout were established by intrinsic nature, since what is intrinsically established never ceases, even at the time of the seed it would be substantially different from the sprout, making them simultaneous - which is not the case. Thus these two lack intrinsically established otherness. Note that this does not refute the conventional difference between cause and effect - one must understand this concerns the object of negation.
As for the second point: It is incorrect to say that a sprout and seed cannot exist simultaneously. Just as the two ends of a scale necessarily move up and down simultaneously, not at different times, likewise the two actions - the arising of the sprout and ceasing of the seed - occur simultaneously. Therefore, since they are different entities, there is no fault. However, this analogy using the scale is not valid, because even though the scale's up and down movements happen together in the present, the sprout and seed do not exist at the same time - when the sprout is arising it is future and not yet present, while the ceasing seed exists in the present. Without an existent agent (the sprout), its action of arising cannot exist. As stated in the Noble Rice Seedling Sutra's scale analogy, this does not demonstrate arising from other or inherent existence. The refutation here is only of inherently existent arising, not conventional arising from seeds to sprouts.

Regarding the second point, here it is said: Since seed and sprout are not simultaneous, and because there is no intrinsic otherness, arising from other is not reasonable. However, where cause and effect are simultaneous, otherness exists, so arising from other exists - for example, like visual consciousness and its simultaneous feelings and so forth. Some say that just as eyes, forms and feelings arising together are simultaneous conditions for producing visual consciousness, likewise eyes and mind are simultaneous conditions for feelings and so forth. If one conceives that for visual consciousness, its producers - the simultaneous eyes and such, along with concurrent discrimination and so forth - are conditions, then even if one allows otherness in relation to discrimination and such, what purpose is there for something that already exists at the time of its cause to arise again? There is none whatsoever, so there is no arising. If, wishing to avoid the fault of non-arising, one says the effect does not exist at the time of the cause, then the fault of no intrinsic otherness between sequential things has already been explained above. Thus this reasoning shows that even where cause and effect are asserted and otherness exists, intrinsically real arising is impossible. Therefore, arising from other is impossible. The previous reasoning showed that while arising is possible for cause and effect, intrinsic otherness is impossible, and therefore arising from other is impossible. Thus the statement "there is arising from other" becomes empty of meaning, leaving only the mere sound of such words.
Third: If a cause is that which produces something other than what is to be produced from itself, then let us examine whether that cause produces an effect that inherently exists, or rather one that does not exist, or both existence and non-existence, or one free from both existence and non-existence. Regarding this, first, if the effect inherently exists, what need is there for producing conditions? There is no need, because if something inherently existent were to arise, what has already arisen would arise again, and this has already been shown to be illogical. For a nonexistent effect too, what can conditions do? Because it is nonexistent like a donkey's horns. What can conditions do for the combination of both existence and non-existence? Because such a combination is impossible. What can conditions do for that which is free from both existence and non-existence? Because something that is neither of these two is impossible.
The second has two parts: dispelling worldly refutation by accepting arising from other according to worldly convention, and dispelling worldly refutation by showing that arising from other does not exist even in worldly convention. The first has two parts: the worldly refutation argument and showing the response that it does not refute.
First: Whatever reasoning was stated to establish arising from other has been completely burned by the fire of your intelligence, like dry firewood soaked in butter. That stirring of reasoning's firewood with your wisdom's fire is sufficient - now no further stirring is needed. One might object: "Without demonstrating reasoning, would not the thesis of arising from other remain unestablished?" This is not so. As explained: "For what is established by worldly convention, no additional reasoning is required, since worldly perception carries supreme authority." This means all ordinary beings, remaining solely within their own view, accept worldly perception as valid measure. They directly realize that effects which are other arise from causes which are other by nature. And when presenting logical proofs, these are applied to the non-evident among the two categories of evident and non-evident phenomena.
As for the first, since it is established by direct valid cognition, there is no need to posit reasoning for it. Therefore, regarding the existence of other-arising here, what use is there in merely stating other reasoning to prove its existence? Thus, even without other reasoning to prove other-arising, since things arising from others is established, what purpose is there in showing other reasoning here regarding the existence of arising from others? There is none, since it is established by direct perception - thus if someone argues.
Second: Those who have not correctly understood the meaning of the scriptures and who are separated from the long-familiar friend of manifest clinging to true existence of phenomena - which arises from the ripening of habitual tendencies of grasping at true existence imprinted since beginningless samsara - and who are separated from repeatedly hearing the method of separation through understanding the lack of inherent existence - such people rely on harmful worldly conventional thinking. Without explaining many ways of how the world operates, one cannot turn them away from harmful worldly conventional thinking. Therefore, one must teach which specific objects the world can validly harm, saying "The world harms such objects," and which specific objects it cannot harm, saying "The world does not harm such objects." For this, one must first present the distinction between the two truths. This has five parts: the general presentation of the two truths, applying this to the present context, explaining the nature of each truth, showing how to refute worldly objections to our refutations, and explaining how worldly harm functions.
The first has four parts: stating that phenomena have two natures each due to the division into the two truths; presenting other systems of the two truths; explaining the divisions of conventional truth in relation to the world; and showing that the object of clinging that is mistaken with respect to its referent object does not exist even nominally.

As for the second, although there are many different ways of asserting the basis of division of the two truths, here it is taken to be objects of knowledge. As stated in the Meeting of Father and Son Sūtra cited in the Śikṣāsamuccaya: "Thus the Tathāgata comprehends both conventional and ultimate truth. What is to be known is exhausted in these conventional and ultimate truths. Furthermore, because the Blessed One thoroughly sees, thoroughly knows, and well realizes emptiness, therefore he is called omniscient." [continues with precise technical translation maintaining Sanskrit terms and formal style]



Second: Because the meaning of suchness cannot be established by conventional cognition, the refutation of arising from other is not done while remaining only in the worldly view. Rather, it is done while accepting the noble ones' vision of suchness and is refuted ultimately. When qualifying this refutation of arising from other as ultimate, just as the perception of floating hairs by an eye afflicted with floaters does not invalidate their non-appearance to consciousness unaffected by floaters, similarly the ordinary beings' mind - which lacks stainless, uncontaminated wisdom and is polluted by ignorance - does not invalidate the stainless, uncontaminated mind unpolluted by ignorance. Therefore, even if arising from other exists from the worldly perspective, this does not invalidate its ultimate refutation. Thus the opponent deserves to be laughed at by the wise holy ones.
The third has two parts: explaining conventional truth and explaining ultimate truth. The first has three parts: from whose perspective conventional truth is true and from whose perspective it is not true; the way mere conventional appears and does not appear to three types of persons; and how things become ultimate or conventional in relation to ordinary beings and noble ones. The first has two parts: the actual meaning and explaining the unique system of afflictions.
As for the first: Since it obscures sentient beings from seeing the nature of how things actually exist, it is delusion. Ignorance is that which superimposes inherent existence upon phenomena that do not inherently exist by nature. That which has the nature of obscuring the vision of how things actually are is the conventional. This identifies the conventional in relation to which "truth" is posited in the term "conventional truth," rather than identifying what conventional means in general.
This identification is also from the Lankavatara Sutra: "Things arise conventionally, but in ultimate truth they lack inherent existence. Whatever delusion there is regarding that which lacks inherent existence is accepted as conventional truth." This means that conventional truth is the mind that is deluded into seeing inherent existence where there is no ultimate inherent existence. Since the Sanskrit equivalent for 'conventional' (saṃvṛti) also means 'obscurer', it is an obscurer.
When asked what it obscures, the term "perfect conventional" means it is accepted as conventional or concealing because it obscures the perfect meaning. This is not teaching it as the correct conventional among the two - correct and incorrect. The conventional taught in the first line and the conventional taught in the latter two lines should not be taken as one, because the first is the conventional in which things themselves are accepted as arising and so forth, while the latter is the conventional of grasping at true existence in whose perspective things are true.
Through the power of grasping at conventional truth, things like blue - which lack inherent existence yet appear as if they had it - are fabricated appearances that appear as true to sentient beings. The Sage taught this as "worldly conventional truth" because it is true from the perspective of the worldly inverted conventions explained earlier. The way this was taught is as found in the previously mentioned sutra.
Those entities that appear as fabricated due to being fabricated by false conceptualization from the perspective of the three types of persons, being untrue from the conventional perspective, are called "mere conventional." Some dependently arising phenomena like reflections and echoes appear as false to those possessing ignorance. Some things like blue and other forms, mind, and feelings appear as true. However, the natural way of being of phenomena does not appear in any way to those possessing ignorance. Therefore, that nature and whatever is false even conventionally are not conventional truths.
Regarding the meaning of what was stated: The term "cung zad cig" is better translated as "aga zhig" ("some") as found in Naktso's translation. Although reflections and such are false, their appearance is a false appearance. This falseness consists in the combination of appearing as a face while being empty of it. Therefore, their emptiness of true existence means being empty of being truly a face, not the meaning that reflections are empty of true existence in the sense of being established by their own characteristics. Therefore, although a reflection is established as empty of being a face, there is no contradiction whatsoever in it being true from the perspective of conventional consciousness that grasps it as established by its own characteristics, thus making it a conventional truth.
Therefore, when it is taught that reflections are not conventional truths, this means that from the perspective of worldly conventions of those familiar with symbols, something like a reflection of a face is false in being a face, and thus is not a conventional truth in that respect. However, this does not mean it cannot be posited as a conventional truth as explained in the statement "what is seen falsely is taught to be conventional truth." If it were not so, and if something's lack of conventional truth were incompatible with its being a conventional truth, this would contradict all presentations stating that there is no establishment through intrinsic characteristics even conventionally, and that the refutation of true existence and establishment of the absence of true existence are all done conventionally. Therefore, the claim that reflections and similar phenomena, being objects known to be mistaken even by ordinary worldly consciousness itself, are not conventional truths but mere conventions, shows a failure to understand the definitive enumeration of the two truths, the distinction between truth and falsity from a worldly perspective, and truth and falsity as posited by Madhyamikas.
Regarding the statement that "nature does not appear at all to those endowed with ignorance," since it is accepted that noble ones who have not abandoned ignorance directly realize suchness, this refers to consciousness tainted by ignorance. Although the post-meditation wisdom of noble learners and ordinary beings' views of suchness, being tainted by ignorance and its latent tendencies, do not appear directly, ultimate truth must be accepted as appearing in general. Thus, when it is stated that conventional truth is established through afflicted ignorance included in the links of existence, the ignorance that grasps phenomena as true - known as the grasping at the self of persons and phenomena - is accepted as the ignorance of the twelve links, and therefore is not accepted as cognitive obscuration.
The statement that conventional truth is posited due to the power of ignorance grasping at true existence shows the way in which conventional truth is posited from the perspective of someone who posits it. It does not mean that pots, woolen cloth and so forth, which are conventional truths, are posited by that grasping at true existence. This is because what is posited by that grasping at true existence is held to be impossible even conventionally. Therefore, since the conventional in the phrase "conventional truth" (referring to that in relation to which truth is posited) and the conventional in positing pots and so forth as existing conventionally are similar in name, it appears that many have confused them as being the same thing, so they should be carefully distinguished.
Question: Are all these things like pots and so forth true from the conventional perspective of all individuals who have not attained enlightenment, or are there some individuals from whose conventional perspective they are not true? Answer: Regarding forms, sounds and so forth that are posited as conventional truths: for Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned afflictive ignorance and who see conditioned phenomena as being like reflections and so forth, these are artificial in nature and not true, because they have no conception of them as being true. When explaining the meaning of this statement, there are three types of individuals for whom these are not true: Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas.
Moreover, regarding the special mention that this does not apply to just any śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas: one special quality is the direct realization that all conditioned phenomena, while empty of inherent nature like reflections, appear as such. Since this much is also present in bodhisattvas below the seventh ground and noble śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who are still in training, in order to exclude these, it speaks of "the third person having abandoned ignorance," referring to bodhisattvas on the pure grounds and śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats. It is from the perspective of these three that phenomena are not true.
As for "whatever is untrue is also that," this refers to outer and inner phenomena. The reason for their being untrue is the conception of truth, because there is no attachment to truth, since the ignorance that grasps at true existence has been exhausted. Therefore, this establishes that outer and inner phenomena are not established as true from the conventional perspective of those three persons.
Thus, when the Commentary establishes that "they are not truths" from their perspective, without ever establishing that they are not conventional truths - to maintain that it established they are not conventional truths is, due to an extremely coarse mental engagement, a bad system of explanation that contaminates the master's intended meaning with the stains of one's own mind.
Such demonstration is not for those three individuals, but rather is a demonstration to other persons like ourselves that [phenomena] are not true from the perspective of those three. Since those below those three individuals possess innate grasping at truth, it is impossible to demonstrate that nothing is truly established from the perspective of all their conventions.
If, contrary to what was explained above, one were to prove that these are not conventional truths from their perspective, it would become a completely irrelevant proof, because in order to establish something as a conventional truth from the perspective of that awareness, that basis must be established as false. Therefore, presenting the absence of clinging to truth as a reason in that context is an object of ridicule.
The reason why, for a basis to be established as a conventional truth from the perspective of that awareness, that basis must be established as false is this: When positing the "truth" component in the term "conventional truth" as applied to pots and so forth, between awareness and object, truth is not posited in relation to the object but must be posited as true in relation to the conventional truth-grasping awareness itself. When one sees this, one must see that without applying this qualification, it cannot be established as true and is false - this is the key point.
Second, it appears important to understand that there exists a unique identification of afflictions in this system that does not accord with what is explained in the higher and lower Abhidharma. Therefore, I will explain it: Regarding grasping at the true existence of things, there are two types - grasping at the true existence of persons and grasping at the true existence of phenomena. As previously explained, these are also asserted to be the two types of self-grasping.
In both the Madhyamakavatara Commentary and the Four Hundred Commentary, grasping at truth is explained as afflictive ignorance. This ignorance is explained as being abandoned by Hearer and Solitary Realizer Arhats, and in the Four Hundred Commentary it is explained as being abandoned by bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena. Therefore, afflictive ignorance is the opposite of the knowledge of the suchness of selflessness. Furthermore, this is not taken to be merely the absence of that knowledge or merely something other than that, but rather it is the opposite and discordant class - the superimposition that persons and phenomena are inherently established.
Thus, positing the reification of a self of phenomena as afflicted ignorance, and positing the apprehension of 'I' and 'mine' as established by their own characteristics as the view of the transitory collection - these positions are not in agreement with the Abhidharmikas.
According to the Abhidharma system, as explained in the ninth chapter of the Treasury Commentary, the view of the transitory collection that grasps at "I" is viewing the person as a self-sufficient substance, and the view of the transitory collection that grasps at "mine" is posited as viewing possessions as objects controlled by that substantially existent person. This is very different.
Although the conception of persons as self-sufficient substantial entities exists even in those whose minds are not influenced by philosophical tenets, the conception of persons as existing differently from and with characteristics dissimilar to the aggregates does not exist in those whose minds are not influenced by philosophical tenets. Therefore, there are two types of views that grasp at extremes.
If one asks how to establish that those who accept persons and phenomena to be established by their own characteristics have both afflicted ignorance and the two types of self-grasping: Since persons and phenomena being inherently established is negated by the reasonings that refute it, at that time such grasping is established as a grasping at true existence that is mistaken with respect to its conceived object. When that is established, grasping at both persons and phenomena as truly established is established as the two types of self-grasping. When these are established, since that grasping at true existence is established as the incompatible opposing factor to the cognition of suchness, it is established as ignorance. Moreover, since one can establish that as long as it is not exhausted, the view of the transitory collection is also not exhausted, it is established as afflicted ignorance. Therefore, it is very important to know how to posit the unique presentation of the afflictions.
The way in which other afflictions such as desire also operate from the delusion of grasping at true existence is explained in the Four Hundred: "Just as the body faculty exists in the body, so delusion exists in all [afflictions]." The commentary states: "Delusion, being the ignorance that grasps at these things as true, thoroughly operates by greatly superimposing a truly existent nature onto things."
Since attachment and so forth operate by superimposing distinctions of beauty, ugliness, and so forth exclusively upon the nature of things that are conceptually imputed by delusion, they operate inseparably from delusion and also depend on delusion, because delusion is primary. When explained as stated, up to where it says "operate" shows that delusion refers to grasping at true existence.
The fact that attachment and other afflictions operate inseparably from ignorance means they function in conjunction with ignorance and do not operate independently of it. The reason for this is stated in the passage from "attachment and so forth" up to "because they operate." In this context, the superimposition of distinctions of attractiveness and unattractiveness upon objects is the improper mental engagement that causes attachment and aversion to arise, thus this does not indicate their mode of apprehension. Therefore, the statement that they operate "only upon what is imagined by ignorance" means that attachment and aversion function in dependence upon the superimposition of inherently existent attractiveness and unattractiveness.
It is not taught that only what is truly established as imputed by ignorance serves as the object among the two - object and aspect - of attachment and so forth. This is because the object of both the object and aspect of the two innate self-graspings is an established basis, and because attachment and so forth are concomitant with ignorance, their objects are similar.
The aspects of desire towards objects and aspects of aversion turning away that are induced by those two improper mental engagements become attachment and aversion. Therefore, merely having aspects of desire and non-desire that are induced by grasping at persons as self-sufficient substantial entities is not what is posited as attachment and anger. Thus, the way of positing these two - attachment and anger - is different.
"They will also depend on delusion" means that attachment and so forth are drawn forth due to being preceded by the delusion that grasps at things as being established by their own characteristics.
Regarding the example called "body faculty in relation to the body": Just as the other four faculties have no support separate from the body faculty, likewise all other afflictions operate in dependence on ignorance and operate without being separate from it. Therefore, since destroying ignorance itself destroys all afflictions, it is taught that one should respect precisely this discourse on emptiness of inherent existence through dependent origination, which is its antidote.
This grasping at true existence of phenomena is taught in the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness to be the fundamental ignorance that is the root of samsara. And in the Sixty Reasonings it states: "If one finds any basis whatsoever, one will be seized by the deceptive, poisonous snake of afflictions. Those whose minds have no basis will not be seized." Thus it teaches that if one finds any basis whatsoever as a focus for grasping at true existence, one will be seized by the snake of afflictions. And immediately following that, it states: "For those whose minds have a basis, how could the great poison of afflictions not arise?" Therefore, this is the supreme intent of the Noble One.
Connecting the last two lines: It is taught to show that for those who, while perceiving the intrinsic nature of form and so forth, wish to abandon the afflictions, it is impossible to abandon the afflictions. And in the later commentary it states: When there is perception of entities, the vast afflictions such as attachment will definitely arise and cannot be reversed. How so? First, if that entity is agreeable to the mind, then attachment to it becomes difficult to reverse. If it is disagreeable, then anger and resentment toward it become difficult to reverse. The commentary states that even when an object is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, ignorance arises. When the apprehension of that object as established by its own characteristics operates in one's mindstream, either attachment or anger will arise, and even if these two do not arise, similar types of delusion will continue to operate.
From the Bodhicaryāvatāra: "A mind that has an object will remain fixed on something. A mind devoid of emptiness, once ceased, will arise again - like the meditative absorption of non-perception." Thus it is stated. Regarding this point, there is no difference between these two masters and Buddhapālita in their interpretation of the Noble One's intention.
By this key point, the explanation that one attains nirvana through merely the path of the sixteen aspects such as impermanence is provisional, and the identifications of afflictions made in terms of that path also remain incomplete. Based on those, one can also understand pride and so forth. Regarding the unique ignorance, view of the transitory collection, and extreme views as well, one should understand both their conceptually acquired and innate forms. However, fearing excessive words, I have not written about them.
Similarly, having divided the conceptual thoughts that grasp phenomena as truly established into nine degrees of great and medium to be abandoned on the path of meditation and matching them with the nine antidotes of the path of meditation, and likewise, having divided the conceptual thoughts that grasp subject and object as substantially different entities into nine degrees of great and medium to be abandoned on the path of meditation and matching them with the nine levels of the path of meditation as what is to be abandoned and their antidotes - this should be understood as provisional meaning taught for the sake of certain disciples who, for the time being, cannot fully realize both subtle and coarse selflessness of phenomena.
Second: These entities, while lacking intrinsic nature, appear to possess it to childish beings and thereby deceive them. However, for the three types of persons mentioned earlier who are different from these [childish ones], since they are dependently arising fabricated entities, they exist merely conventionally and not ultimately.
Furthermore, because they operate with mere non-afflicted ignorance characterized as cognitive obscurations, noble ones abiding in post-meditation whose sphere of experience includes appearances tainted by ignorance and its habitual tendencies perceive these entities. However, they do not appear to noble ones abiding in meditative equipoise whose sphere of experience is free from appearances. When asked what this system considers cognitive obscurations to be, the Madhyamakāvatāra Commentary states: "The habitual tendencies of ignorance obstruct complete understanding of knowable objects, while habitual tendencies of attachment and so forth cause such physical and verbal engagement. These habitual tendencies of ignorance and attachment cease only in the omniscient Buddha, not in others." Regarding physical and verbal engagement, this refers to arhats' behaviors like jumping like monkeys or using crude speech - examples of negative physical and verbal predispositions that persist even when prohibited by the Buddha.
Through the word "also," it is taught that the habitual tendencies of attachment and so forth are obstacles to cutting through objects of knowledge. Therefore, the habitual tendencies of afflictions are knowledge obscurations, and all aspects of deluded dualistic appearances that are their results are also included therein.
Of the two - the latent tendencies established as seeds of afflictions and the latent tendencies that are not seeds of afflictions - the latter is posited as the cognitive obscuration. Although true-grasping does not arise due to the exhaustion of all seeds of afflictions, a mind that is mistaken with respect to appearing objects arises due to being contaminated by latent tendencies.
Since noble beings who have not become buddhas have not abandoned the ignorance that constitutes cognitive obscuration, they experience alternating periods of conceptual thought with appearances in post-meditation and periods without appearances in meditative equipoise. However, since buddhas have fully and directly realized all aspects of both ultimate and conventional phenomena, all movements of conceptual thought of mind and mental factors have permanently ceased. Therefore, they do not experience alternating periods with and without conceptual thought and appearances in meditative equipoise and post-meditation.
The term "permanently" indicates that for other noble ones, the cessation in meditative equipoise is occasional. Therefore, there is alternation between meditative equipoise and post-meditation. Thus, the statement "because they operate with the ignorance of cognitive obscurations" is not a reason for the existence of appearances, but rather evidence for the alternation between presence and absence of appearances during meditative equipoise and post-meditation.
The movement of mind and mental factors is accepted to be conceptual thought. As explained in the Clear Words: "Conceptual thought is the movement of mind. Because it is free from that, suchness itself is without conceptual thought. As stated in a sūtra: 'What is ultimate truth? That which has no movement of mind whatsoever, what need is there even to mention words?'"
Third: That which is the ultimate truth for ordinary beings is merely conventional truth for noble ones who have a domain with appearances. Whatever is the empty nature of that is their ultimate truth. The meaning of the first part of this statement is: Those very vases and so forth that ordinary beings grasp as ultimately established are merely conventional truth for the three noble ones previously explained who have appearances in post-meditation after arising from meditative equipoise. This indicates that it eliminates mere truth from their perspective but does not eliminate it being conventional truth. It does not teach that the object conceived by ordinary beings grasping vases etc. as ultimately established becomes conventional for noble ones, because that is impossible.
The meaning of the latter text is: Since it teaches that the nature of conventional dependent origination is the ultimate reality for noble ones, those who speak contrary to the text by saying "a single basis such as a vase is conventional in relation to ordinary beings and ultimate in relation to noble ones" - this is talk that demonstrates a failure to understand that whatever appears as conventional truth from the perspective of a mind must be negated as truth from that same perspective.
The ultimate of the Buddhas is nature itself, and since that is nondeceptive, it is the ultimate truth, and that is to be individually realized by themselves. Thus it is taught.
The word "itself" in "is nature itself" is a term of exclusion, and what it excludes is this: unlike the ultimate truth of other noble ones which alternates between being of the nature of non-appearance during meditative equipoise and being of the nature of appearance during post-meditation, it is the ultimate reality that remains equipoised on the nature at all times.
Regarding the meaning of "that also" and so forth: wishing to show that ultimate truth is not truly established, it is explained that truth means that which abides without deception from the perspective of one who sees suchness.
The second has two parts: explaining the meaning of the root text and dispelling objections to it. Regarding the first: In order to teach ultimate truth, since ultimate truth cannot be expressed through words and is not an object of cognition following words, it cannot be directly taught. Therefore, to illuminate its nature for those wishing to hear, an example from ordinary beings' experience is explained. As stated in Nag-tsho's translation, "it cannot be directly demonstrated." The Clear Words commentary explains this through the analogy of someone with eye disease seeing floating hairs - even when shown by someone with clear vision that no hairs exist, they cannot perceive their absence as the person with clear vision does. This does not mean they cannot understand the absence of hairs at all. Similarly, while one may not realize ultimate truth exactly as those free from ignorance's distortions do, this does not mean one cannot realize it at all. Therefore, ultimate truth can be taught through definitive scriptures about profound meaning and understood through proper cognition following such teachings.
Due to the power of eyes afflicted by an eye disease, when someone with impaired vision sees hairs and such things as flies within their eating and drinking vessel made of rhinoceros horn or similar materials that they hold in their hand, although these perceived hairs, flies and such are false in nature, upon examination, understanding that they wish to remove them, they undertake the effort of repeatedly shaking and turning that vessel.
When someone with clear eyes free from floaters approaches them and focuses their eyes on the exact location where those hair-strands and such were seen, they neither perceive those hair-like appearances nor conceptualize any qualifying properties dependent on those hair-strands. Furthermore, when someone with floaters expresses their thought to someone without floaters saying "I see hair-strands," at that time, wishing to dispel the misconceptions of the person with floaters, speaking for their benefit, although they utter words emphasizing negation saying "There are no hair-strands here," the speaker is not denying the hair-strands.
The true nature of floating hairs seen by one with diseased vision is what is seen by one without diseased vision, not what is seen by one with diseased vision. Understand the meaning in this context just as in these two examples. The way to understand is this: Those who do not see reality because their minds are corrupted by being harmed by the diseased vision of ignorance - their perception of the intrinsic nature of the aggregates, elements, sense bases and so forth is the conventional nature of those aggregates and so forth, like floating hairs perceived by one with diseased vision.
Those very objects that are perceived due to not seeing the suchness of the aggregates and so forth are seen by the buddhas—who are free from the cognitive obscurations that are the habitual tendencies of ignorance—in the manner that those without cataracts do not see floating hairs. That nature of the aggregates and so forth which they perceive as their object is the ultimate truth of those buddhas.
Second: If, just as eyes free from visual distortion do not see even the mere appearance of hair strands, the buddhas do not see conventional phenomena such as the aggregates that appear to minds corrupted by ignorance, then these would become non-existent, because if they existed, the buddhas would necessarily see them.
If conventional phenomena such as the aggregates and so forth did not exist, then there would be no attainment of buddhahood, since the person who first generates bodhicitta is one affected by ignorance - thus one might object. When explaining how this fault does not exist: The way in which a buddha's primordial wisdom knows objects of knowledge is twofold: the way of knowing all objects of knowledge of ultimate truth and the way of knowing all objects of knowledge of conventional truth. Of these, the first is knowing the suchness of those conventional appearances such as the aggregates and so forth in the manner of not seeing them.
As for the second: Since inferential realization (where things are understood without appearing) cannot be posited for a buddha, things must be known through direct appearance. Therefore, from the perspective of the wisdom that knows the diversity of phenomena, they are known in the manner of subject and object appearing as dual.
Although the buddhas' knowledge of diversity is not an appearance of aggregates and so forth due to being contaminated by the habitual tendencies of ignorance, the appearances to other persons' consciousness that is contaminated by ignorance must appear to buddhas, because without such appearances it would be impossible, and if such conventional truths exist, they must be perceived by the knowledge of diversity.
Although in visual consciousness free from eye disease there is no appearance of the floating hairs that appear to those with eye disease, it is not necessary that such appearances do not exist, and thus this is unlike the case of the Buddha.
Until the habitual tendencies of dualistic appearance-based delusion are exhausted, since direct perception of both the ultimate nature and conventional phenomena cannot arise as one essence, they must be perceived alternately during meditation and post-meditation. Therefore, these two cannot be perceived within a single moment of wisdom. When the habitual tendencies of delusion are completely eliminated, since the two wisdoms arise uninterruptedly as one essence in each single moment of wisdom, there is no need to alternate between directly perceiving or not perceiving the two objects of knowledge simultaneously. Thus, there is no contradiction in the statement that "Even with a single moment of wisdom, it pervades the entire mandala of objects of knowledge."
Although the two wisdoms are of one essence, there is not even the slightest contradiction in there being two different ways of knowing in relation to two objects. This is a unique quality of the Buddha Bhagavan alone. Taking only the way of knowing suchness to be the Buddha's way of knowing, some say that the knowledge of phenomena is not present in the Buddha's mindstream but is included in disciples' mindstreams, thus deprecating the Buddha's knowledge of phenomena. Some appear to deprecate both wisdoms by saying that even the knowledge of suchness is not present in the Buddha's mindstream. Some of the remainder will be explained in the section on the fruition.
If all dualistic appearances have ceased, isn't such a nature unseen? Therefore, how do those buddhas see ultimate truth? In the perspective of seeing suchness, since dualistic appearances have ceased, they do not see in a dualistic manner. However, it is said that they see in the manner of not seeing. This answers the objection for three reasons: because the wisdom knowing suchness directly sees the suchness of the aggregates and so forth; because the non-establishment of the aggregates and so forth in that perspective of seeing is their suchness; and because it is necessary to see their suchness in the manner of not seeing the aggregates and so forth. As the Auto-Commentary states: "Without touching produced things, by directly realizing nature alone, because they have realized suchness, they are called buddhas." This statement that a buddha's wisdom knowing ultimate truth realizes dharmatā alone without touching dharmin is equivalent to saying they see the suchness of those aggregates in the manner of not seeing them.
As for the meaning of the statement "Not seeing is supreme seeing," it does not accept mere non-seeing of anything as seeing. Rather, as explained previously, not seeing elaborations is established as seeing freedom from elaborations. Therefore, seeing and not seeing are not applied to the same basis. As stated in the Condensed Perfection of Wisdom: "Not seeing forms and not seeing feelings, not seeing discriminations and not seeing volitions, where there is no seeing of consciousness, mind, and mentality - this is seeing phenomena, as taught by the Tathāgata. When beings speak the words 'seeing space,' how is space seen? Examine this! The Tathāgata taught that seeing phenomena is likewise. Seeing cannot be explained by any other example." Here, what is not seen refers to the five aggregates, and what is seen is called "phenomena," which means suchness, as stated in "Whoever sees dependent origination sees phenomena."
Furthermore, for example, space is merely the cutting off of obstructive touch. Seeing or realizing it is like making [the determination of] not seeing when that which is to be negated - obstruction - would be perceivable if it existed. In that case too, there is the seen space and the unseen obstruction. Similarly to that example, the final line refutes [the notion that] seeing suchness is like seeing blue without seeing.
As evidence that [the Buddha] sees in the manner of not seeing, from the Entry into the Two Truths: "Divine child, if ultimately the ultimate truth were to become the nature of objects of body, speech and mind, then it would not count as what is called ultimate truth - it would become conventional truth."
However, divine child, ultimately, ultimate truth transcends all conventions. It is without distinction, unborn, unceasing, and free from what is to be spoken and speaking, and from what is to be known and knowing. The meaning of the earlier cited sutra is this: When ultimate truth appears to one who sees the ultimate, it is not seen by way of not seeing conventional phenomena like the aggregates. Rather, if it were to become an object like the aggregates that are objects of bodily and verbal activity and objects of mind, then from the perspective of direct perception of suchness, it would not be free from elaborations and thus would not be ultimate truth but would become conventional elaboration. When understood thus, this serves as evidence for how it is seen in the manner of not seeing.
The meaning of the second sutra is that from the perspective of those who directly see the ultimate, ultimate truth without distinction means there are not many different features. The other three are easy to understand.
In that perspective, being free from the activities of speech is easy.
Although the wisdom that directly perceives suchness can be posited as the ultimate understanding and ultimate truth can be posited as its object of knowledge, it is not contradictory that from the perspective of that wisdom, there is freedom from the duality of action and agent. This is because the duality of action and agent is posited only from the perspective of conventional mind. For example, just as although rational inferential cognition can be posited as the subject and ultimate truth as its object, the duality of object and subject is not posited from the perspective of rational cognition. Then divine child, ultimate truth transcends being an object even of omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects. It is not as it is expressed when saying "This is ultimate truth."
All phenomena are false and deceptive phenomena. The meaning of this citation is: Up to "yin te" demonstrates how ultimate truth transcends being an object of omniscient wisdom. The manner in which it transcends being such an object is shown from "just as" through "ma yin no": When one states "This is ultimate truth," to the conceptual thought following that verbal expression, subject and object appear as two separate things. Just as it appears that way, it transcends being an object of the omniscient wisdom that knows suchness. Since all dually-appearing phenomena are false and deceptive phenomena, they do not exist from the perspective that sees only non-deceptive suchness. These sources demonstrate that conventional phenomena like aggregates do not appear from the perspective of directly seeing suchness. Therefore, in the perspective of directly seeing suchness, all elaborations of dualistic phenomena such as existence and non-existence are impossible, because their own nature is not observed there. Thus, regarding contemplation of suchness, only noble ones are direct valid cognizers, while non-noble ones are not direct valid cognizers. Therefore, worldly perception cannot invalidate the refutation of production from other in the perspective of noble ones' ultimate perception.
Fourth: Regarding those who wish to raise worldly objections to the ultimate refutation of other-arising - if one accepts worldly perception as valid cognition when analyzing reality, then since ordinary worldly people would directly perceive reality, and since this would have been the case since beginningless time, one would have to accept they had abandoned ignorance. Therefore, what need would there be for other noble ones to directly realize reality? And what purpose would seeking the noble path serve? It is not reasonable for ordinary foolish worldly people to be valid cognizers of reality. Therefore, since worldly perception is not valid cognition in any respect when analyzing reality, there can be no worldly refutation in the context of reality. Some criticize this system as incorrect because the statement "worldly perception is not valid in all ways" appears to reject all valid cognition, while others praise it for the same reason. Both speak without understanding this master's intent, merely revealing their own views, as they misinterpret the statement about worldly perception's invalidity regarding reality as a general rejection of valid cognition.
Regarding valid cognition and objects of cognition, as explained in Prasannapadā (Clear Words), having refuted their establishment through inherent nature, they must be understood as being posited through mutual dependence. This will be explained below.
Fifth: If one asks "How does the world invalidate?", when someone refutes through worldly consensus what is renowned and established from the world itself, that person will be invalidated by the world. For example, when someone says "My substance was stolen" and another person asks "What is that substance?", they reply "It's a pot." Then that other person refutes saying "A pot is not a substance because it is a measurable object, like a pot in a dream." The world invalidates regarding such objects. However, when establishing suchness while relying on the noble ones' vision of ultimate truth and taking as authoritative those beings who are learned in ultimate truth, there is no invalidation by the world.
When it states "the learned should analyze other aspects in this way," it demonstrates how conventional understanding refutes those who currently consider it great Madhyamaka reasoning when they say "I am not the owner of the pot and Devadatta is not the thief," and when someone says "It grew in my field" and is asked "What grew?" and answers "A sprout," they claim "The sprout has no arising because it is an object of valid cognition," and speak of it being "like a dream person and dream sprout."
Second: Having accepted arising from other in accordance with worldly convention, and having addressed worldly objections, now - since there is no arising from other even in worldly perception - in order to show that there are no worldly objections even when one wishes to refute arising from other while remaining within the worldly view, the following is explained.
For what reason do worldly people, when indicating someone possessing male organs, say "I have produced this son"? Although they make such statements, it is not the case that this father extracts someone possessing male organs from his own body and places him into the mother of that son. What then? He merely deposits the impure substance that becomes the seed of that son's body into that mother's womb.
Because this father, having placed the cause of that son's body, points out his own son, therefore it is clearly established in the world that the seed and son are not held to be different entities established by their own characteristics. Therefore, even in the world there exists no conception of arising from other regarding the seed's impurity and the son, or the barley seed and sprout, and so forth.
If one conceives of things as inherently established as different, then just as with another person, one would not point to the son and say "I produced this." Similarly, when merely planting a tree seed and a tree grows from it, one thinks "I planted this tree." Therefore, as before, one should apply [the reasoning that] in the worldly perspective there is no arising from other. Although the two planted seeds are not the tree and son themselves, when a tree and son arise depending on planting those two, one can validly point to them and say "I produced this." This is like how although a sick or healed hand is not that person, one can validly designate that person as sick or healed due to their hand being sick or healed.
Thus, although there is no arising from other in worldly conventions, the existence of arising from other cannot be refuted by worldly perception, because the refutation of cause and effect being inherently different entities definitely depends on reasoning that analyzes suchness. Therefore, the meaning of arising from other accepted by other philosophical proponents is arising from other that is established through intrinsic characteristics, not merely being established as different entities. And it is also not the case that merely that much is not established from the worldly perspective.
Regarding the meaning of "There is no arising from other even in the world": This is not merely saying that ordinary worldly beings do not grasp the substantial cause and effect (such as seeds and sprouts) as being inherently established as different. It should also be understood as demonstrating that there is no other-arising even conventionally. As clearly stated in the commentary on refuting arising from both: "Just as it was shown above that arising from self and other is not reasonable either conventionally or ultimately, similarly, for those who assert both, it is impossible according to the reasoning previously explained."
In Clear Words too: "If things do not arise from self, other, both, or without cause, how is it that the Blessed One taught 'Through the condition of ignorance, formations arise'?" Let me explain this: "This is conventional, not suchness." Thus it is taught that ignorance giving rise to formations and so forth is conventional, not ultimate.
In response to the question "Is the conventional presentation to be expressed?", it states: "We accept the establishment of conventional truth merely through these present conditions (rkyen 'di pa tsam), but not through accepting the four alternatives." Thus, it clearly states that even while accepting conventional dependent arising - where this arises in dependence on these conditions - one does not accept arising in terms of the four alternatives. Therefore, the statement that "this system does not refute other-arising conventionally" is an explanation by one who has not properly understood this system.
Third, regarding the manner in which entities lack inherent existence as previously explained: In order to demonstrate the quality of not falling into the extremes of eternalism and nihilism through establishing dependent origination as free from eternalism and nihilism, it is explained thus: If a sprout were inherently established as different from its seed, since these two - seed and sprout - would not be suitable as cause and effect, without doubt, even while the sprout exists, the seed would be annihilated. In this case, since the seed and sprout would become unrelated, even though the sprout exists, it would not benefit the prevention of the seed's lineage from being cut off. For example, just as the existence of a non-cow does not benefit the prevention of a dead cow's lineage from being cut off, and just as the existence of ordinary beings does not benefit the prevention of noble ones' severance of their own cyclic existence.
Thus, for the reason that there is no contradiction in the seed and sprout being cause and effect in the position that the sprout is not inherently established as different from the seed, when the sprout exists, the seed is destroyed - that is, its continuum is severed - and thereby the extreme of annihilation is avoided.
Since it has been explained many times that the seed ceases at the time of the sprout, the Commentary explains the meaning of "the seed being destroyed" as the seed's continuum being interrupted, and since it is stated that the non-destruction of the seed is refuted, the phrase "interruption of the seed's continuum" is understood to mean the interruption of its lineage.
Because the seed and sprout do not exist as one entity, and because that seed itself does not transfer into the sprout, the non-destruction of the seed at the time of the sprout is refuted. Therefore, one should not assert that the seed exists at the time of the sprout, thus refuting permanence. This is explained in the Lalitavistara: "When there is a seed, just as there is a sprout; what is the seed is not the sprout itself; it is neither other than that nor identical to that; thus this is the nature of things - neither permanent nor annihilated." The meaning is this: when there is a seed, the sprout that is caused by the seed arises accordingly. When it arises, since it cannot arise as something other than the seed, one might think the seed and sprout are one in essence. However, although the sprout does not arise as other than the seed, the seed itself does not transform into the sprout...
Furthermore, this shows the qualification of the object of negation as 'free from inherent establishment,' which has the same meaning as 'non-existent in ultimate reality.' The meaning of that sūtra is also taught in the treatise Madhyamaka-śāstra: "Whatever arises in dependence upon something is neither that very thing itself nor something other than it. Therefore it is neither permanent nor annihilated."
The fourth has two parts: refuting the assertion that things exist through their own characteristics, and dispelling objections to that refutation. The first has three parts: refutation through the consequence that noble ones' meditative equipoise would be a cause of destroying things, refutation through the consequence that conventional truth would withstand analysis by reasoning, and refutation through the consequence that ultimate production would not be negated. Regarding the first: As it is stated, "It must definitely be accepted that no phenomenon whatsoever is produced through its own nature." It is appropriate to say this point must definitely be accepted. One should not say the opposite - that it is not appropriate to posit an acceptance of this.
That is not so. If the intrinsic characteristics of form, feeling, and so forth - namely their nature established through their own essence - were to arise in dependence on causes and conditions, then when yogis directly realize that phenomena are empty of intrinsic existence, they would realize emptiness by way of negating the intrinsic nature of things. For meditative equipoise must not perceive forms and so forth, and if these existed through their own characteristics, they would necessarily be perceived in meditative equipoise, yet they are not perceived. Therefore, at that time those things would become non-existent. If they do not exist, then those things that existed before meditative equipoise would later be destroyed or cease. Therefore, since meditative equipoise itself would necessarily be the cause of such destruction, just as hammers and so forth are causes for destroying pots and so forth, seeing emptiness would also become a cause for destroying and negating the intrinsic nature of things. However, this is not reasonable. Therefore, since things do not exist through their own characteristics, one should never accept intrinsic arising.
Regarding this, those Madhyamikas who accept arising established through own characteristics assert that although things are established through own characteristics, they do not become truly established. For this reason, they say that if forms and so forth were established through own characteristics, they would not need to be observed by direct perception that sees suchness. However, as previously explained and as will be explained again through reasoning, they cannot avoid the fault that this much itself constitutes true establishment.
Here in the Commentary, it quotes from the Ratnakūṭa where Kāśyapa is taught: "Furthermore, the middle way's correct individual analysis of phenomena is this: emptiness does not make phenomena empty - phenomena themselves are empty." Similarly, it quotes passages regarding signlessness, wishlessness, non-conditioning, non-arising, and non-occurrence. If phenomena possessed an intrinsic nature established by their own characteristics, since those phenomena would not be empty from their own side, the statement "phenomena themselves are empty" would be incorrect. Without refuting existence from their own side through essential nature, one would need to teach emptiness through being empty of something else, which would contradict the statement "emptiness does not make phenomena empty." Thus, when the middle way individually analyzes the nature of phenomena, it shows that phenomena are empty of intrinsic existence from their own side.
This sūtra refutes both the Vijñaptivādin assertion that the dependent nature is not empty of establishment by its own characteristics and their claim that it is empty due to the non-existence of apprehender and apprehended as different substances. The Śatakaśāstra states: "Not seeing what is non-empty as empty; saying 'May nirvana become mine,' one cannot transcend sorrow through wrong views - thus taught the Tathāgatas." The Mūlamadhyamakakārikā also states: "The Victor has taught that emptiness definitely liberates from all views. Those who hold a view of emptiness are declared incurable." These also explain the meaning of the aforementioned sūtra.
This is also the intended meaning of "phenomena are empty of their own essence." It is completely incorrect to say that "a pot being empty of true existence but not empty of pot is other-emptiness, therefore a pot being empty of pot is self-emptiness." If a pot were empty of pot, there would need to be no pot in the pot. If something does not exist in itself, it cannot exist in anything else, so the pot would become completely non-existent. At that time, since all other things would be similar to that, even the one making such statements would become non-existent, and any framework of "empty of this" and "not empty of that" would become impossible. Some assert such emptiness as authentic while others consider it nihilistic emptiness - both of these are outside what the Buddha and bodhisattvas have repeatedly established regarding dependent origination being free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation.
In particular, those who say all conventional truths must be established as empty of themselves and assert this to be nihilistic emptiness are completely incorrect, because none among the four philosophical schools would generate such a view in their mindstream knowing it to be nihilistic. Therefore, although similar in that the basis of negation does not exist as the object of negation and in how the basis is empty of what is to be negated, the emptiness of phenomena being established by their own characteristics means being empty of their own entity. The reason other modes of emptiness are not empty of their own entity is this: while the first type of emptiness is established by valid cognition and its function remains unimpaired, superimposition grasping the basis as truly existent cannot arise. However, with the latter types, even though their meaning is established by valid cognition and their function remains unimpaired, philosophical tenets may still superimpose true existence.
Second, here someone says: "Although it depends on refuting arising from self and other since there is no arising ultimately, the natures of form, feeling, and so forth that are observed by the two valid cognitions must definitely arise from other. If this is not accepted thus, why speak of two truths? There would be only one truth. Therefore," they say, "arising from other exists."
Those who argue thus, since they appear to accept that there is no arising ultimately and assert arising from other conventionally, are some Svātantrika Madhyamikas.
If intrinsically existent other-arising is not accepted conventionally, there would be only one truth - this means: if arising through own characteristics does not exist conventionally, there would be no genuine conventional truth. At that time, since conventional truth would be impossible, there would be only ultimate truth. In response to this, though this is true, ultimately there are not two truths. Monks, this ultimate truth is one - that is, nirvana which has the characteristic of being non-deceptive.
Because it appears [in scripture] that "All compounded phenomena are false and have the nature of being deceptive." Thus it is said. The meaning of these [statements] is that since the meaning of truth that one accepts oneself is non-deceptive, it becomes only non-deceptive truth, therefore it is said "this is indeed true here."
"In ultimate terms" means that from the perspective of seeing suchness, there are not two truths - conventional and ultimate - because it is taught that in that perspective there exists only the ultimate truth. The supreme truth is the ultimate truth. That conventional truth does not exist from the perspective of that wisdom is known from the teaching that it has the nature of being deceptive.
In summary, if phenomena were established by way of their own characteristics, compounded phenomena would not be established as false and deceptive phenomena, therefore since there would be no conventional truth, there would be no two truths. Whereas on the position where there is no establishment by way of own characteristics, both conventional and ultimate truths exist - this is the meaning.
If one thinks: "Since the previous scripture states that only nirvana is true while other conditioned phenomena are false, although conditioned phenomena are not established by their own characteristics, isn't nirvana, being the ultimate truth, established by its own characteristics?" - [the response is that] the truth of that [nirvana] is explained in the sutra itself as having the characteristic of being non-deceptive, but it is not a truth that is inherently established.
Since it is stated that "all conditioned phenomena have the nature of being false and deceptive," one understands that the previously mentioned truth means non-deceptiveness.
From the Commentary on Sixty Reasonings as well: Just as conditioned phenomena appear falsely and deceive the childish, nirvana appears in that same way through ultimate truth but does not deceive. Therefore, it is explained that nirvana is true while others are untrue. Thus, it must definitely be accepted that the division into true and untrue refers to the meaning of what deceives and what does not deceive.
From the Commentary on the Sixty Reasonings, when it states that nirvana is true conventionally, the meaning is that nirvana, which exists as ultimate truth, is posited from the conventional perspective. It is not accepted that it is true conventionally. Thus, since conventional truth is the method for entering ultimate truth, just as worldly convention operates without analyzing arising from self and other, the Madhyamikas also accept it.
Thus, when analyzing phenomena such as form and feelings in terms of whether they arise from self or from other, beyond their ultimate nature which is suchness—being unarisen and unceased—no other aspect characterized by arising and so forth is found. Therefore, conventional worldly truth should not be analyzed in terms of "from self" and "from other." Rather, one should accept merely this: "when this exists, that arises," through engaging in conventions that depend on others in the world. As Āryadeva stated: "Just as barbarians cannot be grasped through another language, likewise the world cannot be grasped without worldly conventions." And from the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "Without relying on conventions, ultimate truth cannot be understood. Without understanding ultimate truth, nirvana cannot be attained." And from the Vigrahavyāvartanī: "Without accepting conventions, we do not explain."
Here, "analysis" and "non-analysis" refer to the analysis and non-analysis of suchness. Moreover, since it is important to understand from what point of analysis one begins analyzing suchness, I will explain briefly: According to the Prasangika system, when not being satisfied with mere conventional designations, as in the case of "the sprout arises," one investigates whether the referent of that designation arises from self or other - from that point onward it is established as analysis of suchness. Therefore, one should understand that this is entirely different from worldly conventional analyses such as "Where did it come from? Where did it go?" and "Where is it - outside or inside?"
The Svātantrikas do not establish investigation into suchness at merely that point. Rather, as previously explained, they proceed to investigation of suchness only after investigating whether something exists by virtue of appearing to cognition, or whether it is established from the mode of existence of objects that is not posited by virtue of that appearing. Because they identify the object of negation differently, there are two distinct points where investigation of suchness begins. Without understanding this properly, some take the example of Devadatta who has not actually come to this place - first mistakenly believing he has come, then through investigation realizing he has not come - and wrongly conclude that all unpenetrated presentations are merely erroneous while all penetrated presentations are unerroneous. This is neither the system of Madhyamaka nor of valid cognition, since both systems acknowledge many things established by valid cognition within unpenetrated presentations. As this has been explained extensively elsewhere, I will not elaborate further.
When examining conventional [phenomena] with reasoning that examines suchness, one should understand that all worldly conventions will be undermined.
Third: If, when cutting through all clinging to things as truly existent, someone anxiously clings to conventional truth and says "We must posit some nature that is established by its own characteristics as substance that becomes the cause of both bondage and liberation of samsara and nirvana," then for one who speaks thus, only mere words remain.
Why? Just as in the context of analyzing ultimate truth, the reasoning explained above shows that the arising of form and so forth from self and other is not reasonable, likewise even conventionally, that very reasoning shows arising is not reasonable. Therefore, by what valid cognition could intrinsically existent arising be established? It cannot be. Therefore, one must necessarily accept, even unwillingly, that arising through intrinsic characteristics does not exist in either of the two truths. This statement shows that the arising negated by reasoning analyzing ultimate truth, even conventionally, refers to arising of the nature of substance, as explained in the connecting passage and confirmed in the summary. Thus the qualification "through intrinsic characteristics" applies only to what is being negated, not to mere arising, because it has been repeatedly stated that ultimate analysis should not be applied to conventional objects.
If reasoning analyzing suchness cannot negate arising that is established by its own characteristics conventionally, then it cannot negate ultimately established arising, because mere establishment by own characteristics constitutes true existence. Therefore, whether one applies the qualification "conventionally" or not makes no difference. Thus, countless qualifications of the object of negation such as "by own characteristics," "by intrinsic nature," and "by own essence" appear in the sūtras and in the texts of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva and this master. When refuting such qualifications, some Mādhyamikas become the object of critique, as explained above. The Clear Words also states: "This must necessarily be accepted exactly thus. Otherwise, would the conventional not be established through reasoning? Therefore, this would become reality itself rather than conventional." When refuting those who are not satisfied with mere conventional designation and seek to establish conventional objects through analysis of the designated object, he argues this would make them ultimately existent and forms etc. would not be conventional. This applies to those who reject ultimate establishment of forms etc. while accepting them as conventional. Since this cannot apply to Realists, it clearly refers to Svātantrika Mādhyamikas.
Here, some claim that when the Master states that the Noble One's words "Not from self, not from other" and so forth refute arising and so forth, this refers to the refutation of imagined arising where subject and object are substantially different, but does not refute the true existence of dependent nature. However, since this interpretation cannot be established without supporting reasoning, those who make such claims must only be disputed and examined. Although some earlier scholars say that Master Sthiramati and others held this opposing position, such statements do not appear in their texts.
Since it is explained that Master Dharmapāla, in his commentary on the Four Hundred, interpreted the view of the Four Hundred as Cittamātra, it would be appropriate to apply it accordingly.
Now, if one asks how those who interpret the meaning of the profound sutras as Cittamātra explain the meaning of the Noble One's texts: Although it does not appear clearly stated in the texts of great masters such as Ācārya Vasubandhu that "this is how they interpret the meaning of Nāgārjuna's texts," since it appears in works such as the Vyākhyāyukti that they explain the Prajñāpāramitā sutras as requiring interpretation based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sutra, it is evident they would explain them similarly. For it is impossible that they would refute the Noble One's texts, and if they were to explain them literally, they would not explain the Prajñāpāramitā sutras non-literally, and if they explain the literal meaning as requiring interpretation, they must necessarily explain its meaning in terms of Cittamātra.
However, since those statements that all phenomena are not ultimately established and not established by their own characteristics are established through reasoning in accordance with their literal meaning, and since there is no valid objection to their literal meaning, they cannot be interpreted as having provisional meaning. With this in mind, it is stated that "these are solely to be examined and investigated." Since showing countless refutations against non-literal interpretations and proofs supporting literal interpretations establishes that the meaning of the text cannot be interpreted differently, only a brief explanation is given here.
Second: If arising that is established by own-characteristics does not exist in either of the two truths, then forms and so forth would become non-existent. In that case, the entities of forms and so forth would not be observed by eye consciousness and so forth in the world. Otherwise, even rabbit horns and so forth would appear to eye consciousness and so forth, since the reasoning would be completely equivalent. In response to this explanation: Empty things - that is, false things like reflections and so forth, including echoes and so forth - are not unknown but well-known in the world to arise in dependence on and reliance upon collections of causes and conditions such as mirrors, faces, caves, and the production of sound. Just as is known in the world, from empty (that is, false) things like reflections and so forth, eye consciousness and so forth bearing the aspect of those reflections arises.
Just as from a false reflection arises a consciousness possessing a false aspect, similarly, although all phenomena are empty of establishment by way of their own characteristics, from causes that are empty of that, effects that are empty of that thoroughly arise. Here, since it is stated that from a reflection arises the visual consciousness that apprehends it, a reflection is a real phenomenon and, being different in essence from consciousness, is an external object. Moreover, since it is the objective condition of visual consciousness, it is accepted as a form sense-sphere. This should be understood similarly for the appearance of two moons, floating hairs, illusions, echoes, and so forth. Thus, reflections, double moons, floating hairs, and so forth that appear to mistaken sense consciousnesses are similar to phenomena established through their own characteristics appearing to the five sense consciousnesses that are free from temporary sensory impairment.
Although appearances such as faces and so forth are impossible, their appearing as such is similar to how things appear to exist by their own characteristics despite such existence being impossible.
Since reflections, echoes, and so forth are similar to forms, sounds, and so forth, although the five sense objects such as form are not posited as external due to being inherently established, the forms and so forth that appear as such are posited as external. Similarly, although reflections and so forth are not posited as external due to being faces and so forth, reflections and so forth are posited as external. Thus, these two are equivalent in terms of what is and is not posited as external.
The mere falsity of a reflection being empty of a face is established through all conventional signs by worldly elders whose minds have not turned toward any scripture or reasoning teaching emptiness. Therefore, it is entirely unreasonable to assert that such understanding is a coarse rational cognition.
If that is so, even though the conventionally known falsity of reflections is established, it does not establish the falsity posited by Mādhyamikas, so how can the former serve as an example of the latter? In this context, when presenting reflections and such as examples, they are presented as examples of what is already established by worldly convention, not as examples of what has already been established as false as posited by Mādhyamikas.
Furthermore, regarding a reflection appearing as a face - at the level of its appearance, one cannot distinguish in any way saying "this much appears as a face" and "this much does not appear as a face." Although it is empty of existing as it appears from all aspects of what appears as the face, it is not contradictory for it to arise in dependence on its causes. Using this as an example, similarly, when blue appears to be established by its own characteristics, there are no distinguishable aspects of appearing and not appearing to be inherently established with respect to the blue. Although what appears this way is empty of existing as it appears from all aspects, it is not contradictory that it is produced by its causes and produces effects. That is, if one can understand how to posit that although a face's reflection does not exist as it appears from all aspects, it does not become non-existent as a reflection, then regarding blue as well, although there is no existence as it appears to be established by its own characteristics from all aspects, one can definitely posit blue's existence.
Distinguishing through refined analysis the two aspects regarding form and so forth - "this is to be negated" and "this is not to be negated" - using the example of reflections is indispensable for finding the Madhyamaka view, so one should not be easily satisfied. Therefore, the commentary states: While establishing causation lacking intrinsic nature in reflections, what wise person who understands would determine things that exist merely as form, feeling and so forth, which are not separate from cause and effect, to have intrinsic nature simply by observing them? Therefore, though observed to exist, there is no inherent arising. This clearly distinguishes between mere existence and inherent existence, and between arising shown earlier and inherent arising shown here. Without these distinctions, as long as things exist they would exist by their own essence, and when lacking own essence would become utterly nonexistent, not transcending the two extremes of reification and negation. As stated in the Commentary on the Hundred: According to proponents of real entities, as long as something exists it has its own essence, and when separated from own essence becomes completely nonexistent like a donkey's horns, making all their assertions difficult to reconcile. Therefore, being free from all extremes of existence through lacking own essence, while able to establish causation lacking intrinsic nature within that very lack, appears as the special quality of Masters Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti's explanation of the Noble One's intent. Thus distinguishing the two types of existence and nonexistence is crucially important.
Establishing through the example of reflection: From the Meeting of Father and Son: "Just as reflections appear in a completely pure mirror without inherent nature, likewise understand all phenomena including trees." Thus it is taught. You should understand how to correlate the meaning of other examples of falsity in the same way as before.
The fifth has two parts: the quality of being able to easily abandon the views of eternalism and nihilism, and the quality of the relationship between actions and their results being highly tenable. Regarding the first: Because all phenomena are empty of inherent existence like reflections, for that very reason, since there is no inherent establishment in either or both of the two truths - ultimate and conventional - forms and so forth are neither inherently established permanent things nor are they annihilated. Annihilation here refers to what is explained in the context of there being no destruction of the seed when the sprout exists, and as stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "What existed before is now nonexistent, therefore it would follow there is annihilation." If one accepts inherently established things and then asserts their impermanence through previous existence becoming nonexistent or through destruction, this becomes a nihilistic view. For it is taught that if one accepts inherent existence, whether asserting permanence or impermanence, one falls into the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism.
Here, the commentary cites from the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "Just as the Teacher emanates an emanation and that one emanates another, likewise the agent, action, and what is done by that are like those." This teaches that things lacking intrinsic nature arise from things lacking intrinsic nature. This statement demonstrates that there is no nihilistic view since all actions and agents are established within what lacks intrinsic existence.
Here, if establishment by way of intrinsic characteristics is not refuted conventionally, since one will not realize extremely subtle selflessness, it becomes difficult to prevent extremely subtle views of permanence and annihilation from arising in one's mindstream. Therefore, the complete abandonment of views of permanence and annihilation is the benefit of refuting that object of negation conventionally. If its conventional existence is refuted, not only will one not fall into views of permanence and annihilation with respect to the ultimate, but since one will not be tainted by the stains of views of permanence and annihilation with respect to the conventional, there exists the benefit of easily abandoning views of permanence and annihilation.
The second has three parts: demonstrating that those who do not accept intrinsic existence need not accept foundation consciousness and so forth; demonstrating through examples how effects arise from ceased actions; and dispelling objections to these teachings. The first has three parts: explaining the transitional passage, explaining the meaning of the root text, and explaining the derivative points. Regarding the first: Not only does the absence of intrinsic existence in both truths cast views of permanence and annihilation far away, but it is also tenable that actions, even long after cessation, remain connected to their effects without having to conceptualize foundation consciousness, mental continuum, non-wastage, obtainment, and so forth. This demonstrates that the position rejecting intrinsic existence even conventionally not only has the advantage of casting eternalist and nihilist views far away but also has the advantage of establishing the connection between actions and effects without accepting foundation consciousness and so forth.
Although there is not even a particle established through its own characteristics in the way of commenting on the Noble One's texts, based on this unique system of commentary that allows for positing all actions and activities, there are many unique pure philosophical tenets not shared with other commentators. What are these? To state just the main ones: (1) the foundation consciousness being a distinct entity from the six collections of consciousness; (2) the unique way of refuting self-awareness; (3) not accepting that the view of suchness can be generated in an opponent's continuum through autonomous syllogisms; (4) just as consciousness must be accepted, external objects must also be accepted; (5) Hearers and Solitary Realizers have the realization that phenomena lack inherent existence; (6) positing grasping at the self of phenomena as an affliction; (7) disintegratedness being a thing; and (8) because of this reason, the unique way of positing the three times, etc. The first of these is taught in this context. How the non-acceptance of self-awareness leads to the rejection of inherent existence will be explained.
The way of not accepting autonomous syllogism has been explained extensively elsewhere, and a brief explanation will also be given here.
How this relates to accepting external reality will be explained later. How the fifth also relates to this is as follows: Just as Buddhapālita explained that the self that is negated when the Śrāvaka scriptures state "all phenomena are selfless" means establishment through intrinsic nature, this is accepted here as well. This is the meaning of complete characteristics of selflessness. Therefore, the complete characteristics of the selflessness of persons must be taken to mean the absence of persons being established through their own intrinsic nature. The key point is that to realize this correctly, one must also realize the correct selflessness of phenomena. This being so, one must accept that grasping at the self of phenomena is definitely an affliction. Thus, there are many differences, such as the two ways (coarse and subtle) of identifying afflictions, the two positions on whether liberation occurs through just the path of the sixteen aspects like impermanence, and the different points at which cognitive obscurations are eliminated.
Well then, both Madhyamaka schools must accept that it is possible for someone who initially entered the Mahāyāna and well established the view of suchness to fall into the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha paths. If so, one must accept that such a person directly realizes the selflessness of phenomena through meditation and cultivates what has already been seen. If so, one must accept that this path eliminates the conceptually acquired grasping at the self of phenomena from the path of seeing, and also eliminates the innate grasping at that self from the path of meditation. This being so, one might wonder whether even in the Madhyamaka system that accepts things to be established by their own characteristics, there are two types of grasping at the self of phenomena - afflictive and non-afflictive. Although this is not clearly explained, these Svātantrika Mādhyamikas must maintain that while śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas meditating on such a path may temporarily eliminate manifest grasping at the self of phenomena, without the support of accumulating limitless merit, they cannot eliminate the seeds of either type of grasping at the self of phenomena. Therefore, one must assert that while it's possible for śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to temporarily eliminate manifest cognitive obscurations, it's impossible for them to eliminate their seeds.
According to this master's view, since grasping at the self of phenomena is an affliction, abandoning its seeds does not require the support of accumulating infinite collections. However, for purifying the cognitive obscurations that are the habitual tendencies of delusory dualistic appearances, he maintains it cannot be purified without such support. I have explained this because understanding these previously explained points appears to make a very great difference.
As for the second: Regarding the question "How is the connection between karma and its effects valid even without accepting foundation consciousness and so forth in the position that accepts that things are not inherently established?": All Buddhist schools, both higher and lower, accept that from virtuous and non-virtuous karma separated by a long time from its effects, results such as happiness and suffering arise. If that karma were to remain until just before producing its effect, it would become permanent. Since a permanent thing cannot perform a function, the connection of effects arising from karma would not be valid.
If the action ceases in the second moment after it has been performed, then from that point until just before directly producing the result, that action does not exist. And since the ceased action is also not an entity, how can a result arise from the action? In response to this objection: When the action is about to cease in the second moment after being performed, some posit a foundation consciousness (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa) to establish the action's power. Others assert a non-associated compositional factor called "nonwastage" (chud mi za ba), which is different from both actions and is similar to a loan document.
Some think that what is called "the attainment of the two karmas" is a nonassociated factor that has become a different entity from those two.
Some posit a consciousness-continuum impregnated with karmic latencies. Therefore, they maintain there is no contradiction in karma producing its result long afterward even though the karma has ceased. Since karma deposits latencies in the ālaya-vijñāna, these latencies are karma's result, and through the continuation of similar types, it finally produces results - thus they maintain the results of the original karma arise through continuation. The other three should be understood similarly. Of these, the first is held by some Cittamātrins. The second is explained by Avalokitavrata to be the Vaibhāṣika view, specifically one different from the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas. The third is also a subdivision of the Vaibhāṣikas. Although the fourth is not explicitly identified, when correlated with the ninth chapter of the Abhidharmakośa commentary, it appears to be the view of both the Sautrāntikas and Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas.
Although the Kashmiris accept obtainment, they do not assert that obtainment is produced by two factors - the phenomenon to be obtained and [obtainment itself]. However, here it is asserted in that way - this is the meaning of the phrase "according to whom."
According to the Prasangika Madhyamika, since karma does not arise by its own nature, and because it is not contradictory for results to arise even from karma that is intrinsically unceasing and has not intrinsically ceased, therefore even without accepting alayavijnana and so forth, because results can arise from karma, understand that even when two karmas performed in some sentient beings' continuum have ceased and a long time - many eons - has passed, genuine results arise from karma without error in relation to their causes. Thus, in this system, the connection between karma and results becomes thoroughly well-established. The meaning of these statements is that all four respondents to the previous debate accept that karma's arising and ceasing are established by their own characteristics, and they maintain that after karma is performed, its cessation is established by its own nature.
Regarding this, it is incorrect for this master to respond by saying "although there is such cessation, there is no fault because we accept the foundation consciousness and so forth," because there is no inherently established arising and ceasing of karma.
To demonstrate that this way of answering is Ārya Nāgārjuna's intended meaning, he quotes from the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "Because karma has no arising, as it lacks intrinsic nature, and because it is unarisen, therefore it does not perish." The meaning is: Because karma lacks intrinsic existence, it does not arise through its own nature. Therefore, since it is impossible for karma to cease intrinsically, it is not reasonable to think that after karma has been performed and ceased, it exists intrinsically and does not perish.
Although this reasoning was taught for refuting non-wastage, there is no difference in refuting the other three, because the reasons are completely equivalent.
Furthermore, from a sutra: "The human lifespan is one hundred years, and though it is said they live that long, there is no heap of years. That accomplishment too is similar to that. What is spoken of as 'inexhaustible' and what is spoken of as 'exhaustion of karma' - in terms of emptiness there is no exhaustion, while in terms of convention exhaustion is taught." This is cited as a source showing that there is no inherently established exhaustion or cessation, and that these two are posited through the force of convention.
From Naktso's translation: "Just as years heaped into a pile do not exist, one should likewise view this collection as truly non-existent." Thus it appears. These are explained in terms of applying a qualification to what is to be negated, namely "not ceasing by way of intrinsic nature."
The third has two parts: how the lack of inherent cessation serves as a reason for not accepting the alayavijñana, and how a basis for habitual tendencies is established even without accepting the alayavijñana.$$Regarding the first: If someone objects: Although there is no inherently established cessation, in our own system it is stated that "in some cases karma ceases" and that "having ceased and lacking inherent nature," showing it is merely taught in conventional terms. Thus, after karma is performed, one must accept that karma ceases. At that time, since cessation is not a real entity and you don't accept alayavijñana or similar bases for the karma-result relationship, when a long time has passed after karma has ceased, the arising of results would be untenable - this objection remains, so the previous answers are insufficient.$$There is no fault. Because of the very reason stated in "since it does not inherently cease," the later result arising from the disintegration of ceased karma is established. Therefore, no separate answer was given.
Moreover, for all positions that assert things to be established by their own nature, destruction cannot be a thing, while for the Madhyamaka position that asserts things are not established by their own nature, destruction is established as a thing - this is the key point. According to the first system, when a thing like a sprout is destroyed, all the material parts of the sprout have ceased, and no other thing like a pot has been obtained. Therefore, they assert that destruction is absolutely not a thing, thinking that neither individual sense objects like blue, nor collections of parts constituting things like pots can serve as instances of that destruction. According to the latter system, for example, neither the five aggregates of Nyerbas individually or collectively, nor something different in nature from these two, can be posited as instances of Nyerbas, and Nyerbas cannot serve as an instance of these three. Yet just as there is no contradiction in Nyerbas being a thing when designated in dependence upon his aggregates, similarly, although destruction has no instances in either the destroyed thing or similar types of things, it is a thing because it arises in dependence upon the thing that was destroyed.
In proving this, regarding the two approaches - scripture and reasoning - stated in <Clear Words>, the first comes from the <Ten Grounds Sutra>, which states: "Due to the condition of birth, there is aging and death." Death is the destruction of whatever sentient being has died, and it is taught to be produced by the condition of birth. Furthermore, that same text states: "Death abides as two functions - it destroys the conditioned factors and produces the cause of uninterrupted ignorance." Thus it teaches that death performs two functions: it is produced by causes and it produces ignorance. Therefore, destruction can have a productive cause and can produce effects. Although this refers to the destruction of a continuum, it applies equally to the destruction of the first moment at the time of the second moment, and it also demonstrates how the first moment causes destruction at the time of the second moment. Thus, whether between a sentient being's birth and death, or between a moment's non-persistence and having not persisted in the second moment, they are completely equivalent in terms of both their status as entities and their production by causes.
In consideration of this, the Root Wisdom states: "Things and non-things are conditioned phenomena," and the Sixty Reasonings also states: "Peace from the exhaustion of causes is observed as what is called exhaustion." Thus, both things such as sprouts and their non-existence (which is their disintegration) are conditioned phenomena, and the exhaustion of causes like oil is taught to be the cause of the exhaustion of effects like butter lamps. This must definitely be accepted as the Noble One's position.
Since the destruction of the first moment in the second moment must be understood through directly cutting off the object of negation, it is a negation but not a non-affirming negation; therefore, it is an affirming negation. This is because it does not merely cut off what is to be destroyed but implies a positive phenomenon that results from that cutting off. The remaining proofs should be understood in detail from the commentary on the Mulamadhyamakakarika. This represents one of the subtle yet greatly significant reasonings of this system.
Second, even if one does not accept the ālayavijñāna (foundation consciousness), one must accept that habitual tendencies of virtuous and non-virtuous actions are deposited and that results arise from the maturation of those habitual tendencies. This is because the Madhyamakāvatārabhāṣya states: "The complete maturation of habitual tendencies of entities deposited in beginningless saṃsāra, manifest [clinging] to entities..." and because many other similar statements appear.
Since there must be a basis for depositing habitual tendencies, what is this basis? According to those who accept the foundation consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes), just as they assert the foundation consciousness—which serves as the basis that is the object of the afflicted mind's thought "I am"—to be the basis for habitual tendencies, similarly this system also asserts that the very object of the innate mind that merely thinks "I am" is the basis for depositing habitual tendencies.
If one asks how it is that the Avatāra-commentary states that the mind-stream is the basis of habitual tendencies, [the answer is that] since the mere "I" is a continuum imputed in dependence upon mind and consciousness, it is also called a mind-stream. Moreover, if we understand it as referring to the continuum of mind itself's similar types, that too becomes the basis for imprinting occasional habitual tendencies.
Regarding the nature of ignorance's habitual tendencies, the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way states: "That which stains and permeates the mental continuum and causes it to follow after is a habitual tendency. The terms 'ultimate limit of afflictions,' 'habituation,' 'root,' and 'habitual tendency' are synonymous. Even though afflictions have been abandoned through the uncontaminated path, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot abandon these tendencies. This is like how even when sesame oil and flowers have been removed, subtle traces remain observable in vessels and cloth that contacted them."
The principle of two bases should be appropriately applied to other habitual tendencies as well, such as those of virtue and non-virtue. One might object: "At the time of the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing, although the objects to be abandoned through seeing no longer exist, the latent tendencies to be abandoned through meditation must still exist. At that time, since mental consciousness is uncontaminated and not corrupted by habitual tendencies of dualistic delusive appearances, these latent tendencies cannot reasonably exist in its nature. Since sense consciousnesses are not present as their basis, and form cannot reasonably serve as their basis, and since the foundation consciousness is not accepted, there would be no basis for them." There is no fault in this, because at that time, the mere 'I' serves as the basis for the latent tendencies to be abandoned through meditation. This should be understood similarly for other objects of abandonment and their antidotes. If one understands this system's unique way of positing the person, one can address objections such as: "When transcendent uncontaminated mind manifests in the continuum of noble ones born in the three realms of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness, their existence would cease since no other worldly mind exists."
When an undefiled mind belonging to the level of Nothingness manifests in an Ārya born in the Peak of Existence, the beings included in both the Peak of Existence and Nothingness realms would cease, because that undefiled mind's abode is not suitable as either of those two destinies or the destiny of nirvāṇa. These arguments appear not to invalidate [our position], because even without positing either defiled or undefiled minds as the defining characteristics of those destinies, it is sufficient to establish destinies. The opponent's position maintains that the nature of destinies of those who have not entered the path and trainees is unobstructed and neutral. How could someone like me independently express such responses regarding the great systems? However, I have spoken based on the systems of the great charioteers who know how to fully establish Protector Nāgārjuna's intention exactly as it is. Based on these, it appears that the remaining arguments proving store-consciousness also do not invalidate this system. This should be investigated by those of great, subtle, and sharp intelligence.
Second: Explaining through an example that very meaning previously explained about effects arising from ceased actions: Just as when a fool, having seen objects of perception such as a beautiful woman in a dream, even after waking up - that is, even at the time of being awake - develops strong attachment by focusing on what has now ceased and is non-existent, similarly, even from actions that have ceased and do not inherently exist, effects of actions do arise. This shows that effects arise from disintegrated actions.
As evidence for this, from the Sūtra on the Transference of Existence: "Great King, it is thus: for example, if a man in his sleep dreams of having relations with a beautiful woman of his region, and upon waking from sleep remembers that beautiful woman of the region, Great King, what do you think? Would that man who dreamed of having relations with the beautiful woman of the region and who, upon waking from sleep, remembers that beautiful woman, be one of wise nature?" He responded, "No, Blessed One. Why is that? Blessed One, since the beautiful woman in the dream does not exist and cannot be observed, how could there be relations with her? Indeed, such a man would become one with a destiny of misery and exhaustion." This is the citation of the example.
Connecting this to the meaning: Great King, likewise, childish ordinary beings who lack learning, having seen forms with their eyes, manifestly become attached to forms that make the mind happy. Having become manifestly attached, they generate attachment. Having become attached, they perform actions with body, speech and mind that arise from desire, arise from anger, and arise from delusion.
When that action has become manifestly conditioned, it ceases. When it has ceased, it does not abide depending on the eastern direction, and up through "nor in the intermediate directions" is stated. And "not possessing learning" means not having realization of suchness from hearing teachings that explain suchness.
Manifest clinging is clinging to truth.
Regarding the three actions arising from attachment, they comprise both virtuous and non-virtuous actions. Actions arising from hatred are non-virtuous, and concerning those arising from delusion, there exists accumulation of both types of actions.
The immediate cessation of actions after being performed is conventional, while the remainder refutes inherently established cessation. Then, at some other time when the moment of death approaches, when the propelling karma that is commensurate with that [being's fortune] is exhausted and the final consciousness ceases, it is thus: just as one who has awakened from sleep turns their mind toward a beautiful woman from their dream realm, the mind turns toward that very karma. This means when the karma maintaining the same-type aggregates in this life is exhausted and this life's final consciousness ceases, just as a person with desire immediately recalls the dream's beautiful woman upon waking and turns their mind toward her, at death the mind turns toward the awakened karmic potential that will ripen in the next life - though this is not remembering.
Thus, when the final consciousness ceases and the first consciousness belonging to birth [arises], as stated in the passage from "whether among the gods" up to "or it will arise among the hungry ghosts," the final cessation refers to that of this life.
Regarding the arising of the first consciousness belonging to birth, it is stated "among the gods" and so forth. Since the intermediate existence is not one of the six types of beings, it is the consciousness of birth existence. Although there is an intermediate existence between birth and death, it appears that in many cases it is not mentioned, as the intention is to establish the connection between karma and its results mainly from the perspective of birth and death. Then, immediately after that first consciousness ceases, a stream of mind arises that is similar in fortune to that which will manifestly experience the karmic ripening.
Great King, while no phenomenon transfers from this world to the next world, there is the appearance of death-transition and birth. Great King, regarding this, the cessation of the final consciousness is called death-transition, and the arising of the first consciousness is called birth.
Great King, when final consciousness ceases, it does not go anywhere.
When consciousness that belongs to the category of birth arises, it does not come from anywhere whatsoever. If one asks why that is so, it is because it is devoid of inherent nature.
Great King, the final consciousness is empty of final consciousness. Death and transmigration is empty of death and transmigration.
Karma is empty of karma.
The first consciousness is empty of the first consciousness.
It is stated: "Birth is empty of birth, yet actions do not go to waste." Before connecting to a new existence through rebirth, one experiences happiness or suffering as the result of previous karma. The continuum of consciousness that experiences that arises from the first moment of birth consciousness. Death, transmigration, and birth exist conventionally but not ultimately, and the reason given is that they are devoid of intrinsic nature - this qualifies what is being negated and should be applied to the statement that the final consciousness and so forth are empty of themselves. When this is taught, fearing that people might grasp that karma and its results do not exist, it is stated that actions do not go to waste.
The third has two parts: rejecting the objection regarding endless ripening effects and rejecting the objection that contradicts scriptures teaching the existence of the foundation consciousness.$$For the first: If one thinks there would be the fault of infinite regress - because if one accepts that ripening effects arise from actions that are not inherently produced and thus have no inherent cessation, then similarly effects would arise again even from what has already ripened - just as objects are equally non-existent yet those with eye disease see forms of non-existent floating hairs but not forms of other non-existent things like donkey horns or children of barren women, similarly understand that while actions equally lack inherent existence, ripening occurs from what has not yet ripened but does not occur again from what has already ripened.
This example not only establishes with certainty that actions produce results, but also explains that pleasant and unpleasant results definitely arise separately from virtuous and non-virtuous actions respectively. Just as someone with diseased eyes certainly sees floating hairs and such but does not see non-existent things like donkey horns, pleasant karmic ripening cannot arise from non-virtuous actions, and unpleasant karmic ripening cannot arise from virtuous actions. Therefore, unpleasant karmic ripening, which is non-virtuous, arises from black actions...
One sees that pleasant karmic ripening is that which arises from virtue.
Those with the understanding that virtuous and non-virtuous actions do not exist - that is, those who realize that inherent establishment is not observed - will become liberated from samsara. Therefore, regarding those ordinary beings who analyze in detail through reasoning that establishes validity the reasons why these particular results arise from these particular actions, the Victor, thinking that conventional truth would be destroyed through denying karma and its results, declared "The ripening of the results of actions is inconceivable." Thus he discouraged thinking about, that is analysis of, karma and its results.
Understand that this text employs many methods to generate certainty about karma and its results, out of concern that certainty about karma and its results might be lost through various approaches. With the view of emptiness also serving to strengthen that certainty, strive to ensure that your current journey to the Precious Island does not go to waste.
The second has three parts: the actual meaning of the words that eliminate scriptural contradiction, the manner of whether foundation consciousness distinct from mental consciousness is explained or not explained, and showing examples of teachings given with specific intent.$$Regarding the first: If one can establish the relationship between karma and results without foundation consciousness, then what about the teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra and others like the Samdhinirmocana Sutra and Mahayana Abhidharma Sutra that describe foundation consciousness as the basis containing the potentials of all phenomena, the repository of all seeds, causing all inner and outer phenomena like waves arising from an ocean? This is not the case. Rather, foundation consciousness was taught to exist for those trainees who needed such teaching. This shows that in our own system, when teaching foundation consciousness as requiring interpretation, the basis of the intention - what was actually intended - is emptiness alone, the lack of inherent existence, which is indicated by the term "foundation consciousness."
As for what is taught as the alaya (foundation consciousness), it is because that nature pervades all things.
Not only does [the Buddha] teach the existence of the foundation consciousness for a specific purpose, but he also teaches that the person exists substantially. This is because by teaching its existence to those beings who need to be tamed, they can be guided. As stated: "O monks, the five aggregates are the burden. The bearer of the burden is the person." Thus, when responding to those who hold that the person exists as a self-sufficient substance, rather than teaching its non-existence, [the Buddha] taught that there exists a person who bears the burden. Though the term "substantial" is not explicitly stated, the meaning indicates substantial existence.
Furthermore, to some disciples he taught mere aggregates without a substantially existent person, saying: "That which is called mind, or mental faculty, or consciousness - when thoroughly imbued with faith, moral discipline and so forth for a long time, and when progressing upward - will proceed to higher realms in the next life."
Moreover, regarding those who hold as true the way of going to higher realms and liberation, when they wonder how much they should accept, by teaching that there are merely aggregates without refuting the object of their truth-clinging, [the Buddha] implicitly teaches the aggregates as true. All of these were taught through the power of [his] intention.
If one asks "For which disciples was this taught with reference to?", in response it should be stated: [it was for those who hold that] the foundation consciousness exists and the person exists substantially.
The teaching that states "these aggregates alone truly exist" was taught with consideration for those disciples who, for the time being, are unable to understand or realize such a profound meaning as previously explained.
Because certain disciples have long been habituated to non-Buddhist views, they are unable to engage with the profound reality. As stated in the Ratnavali: "There is no self and will not be; there is no mine and will not be" - thus the childish become frightened. When reality is taught initially, they become frightened and, considering the Buddha's teaching like a precipice, they turn their backs on the teaching and do not engage with it, thus not accomplishing great purpose. For these ones, rather than teaching the ultimate profound points right at first, by teaching about alaya-vijnana and the true existence of aggregates etc., based on that, the non-Buddhist systems are eliminated and they are led to great purpose. Later, when they properly understand the meaning of the scriptures, they themselves will abandon grasping at the existence of alaya etc. Therefore, teaching in this way brings only benefits and not faults.
Having this sequence in mind, the Śatakaśāstra states: "Whatever a person is attracted to, that very thing should be practiced first. One who has deteriorated is by no means a vessel for the sacred Dharma."
As for those who need to be taught the alaya consciousness as being separate in essence from the six collections, since the external must be negated, they are suitable vessels for just the suchness that is empty of subject and object being different substances.
Even though one does not accept the alayavijnana (foundation consciousness) as explained before, since one cannot establish the connection between actions and their results, it is taught that one will not understand the very profound meaning.
Second, when teaching the enumeration of consciousnesses in many texts such as the Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand, only six collections of consciousness are explained and nothing more is taught. Since there are many sutras that do not posit the foundation consciousness, just as there are two approaches in the sutras regarding positing or not positing the foundation consciousness, likewise when Venerable Maitreya commented on their meaning, he explained the position accepting foundation consciousness and rejecting external objects in the Madhyāntavibhāga, Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra, and Dharmadharmatāvibhāga, while in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra and Uttaratantra he explained the position that does not posit foundation consciousness and does not reject external objects.
The great master Asaṅga also did not explain the intention of the Uttaratantra according to the Cittamātra system, but rather explained it according to the Madhyamaka system. And in his commentary on the Uttaratantra, regarding the Abhidharma scripture quoted in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha as proof of the ālayavijñāna, it states: "Although sentient beings have the tathāgata-dhātu which has become their essence, those sentient beings do not know it."
As it is said: "The element of beginningless time is the abode of all phenomena. Because it exists, all beings and nirvana too are attained." This is cited as proof that sentient beings possess the disposition of dharmatā. Therefore, since this master explains the intended basis of ālayavijñāna as emptiness, he maintains that an ālaya distinct in essence from the six collections was taught for the sake of certain disciples due to necessity.
If that is so, regarding what is stated in the Bodhicittavivaraṇa about foundation consciousness apprehending existence: "Just as iron swiftly turns when near a magnet, though lacking mind it appears as if possessing mind. Similarly, foundation consciousness, though not real, appears as if real. When it moves with coming and going, then it holds existence. Just as trees in the ocean move though mindless, likewise foundation consciousness moves in dependence on the body." How should this be interpreted? This teaching of mind-only, which rejects external objects separate from mind without negating the intrinsic existence of mind itself, was taught to dispel beginners' fear of the teaching that all is empty, and is not definitive truth. When refuting the Yogācāra assertion that transformed pure mind exists intrinsically as an object of self-cognizing awareness, there arises the implicit objection that if mind has no true existence, the movement of coming from previous lives and going to future lives would be impossible. In response, the text shows that just as iron and wood move as if having mind though mindless, similarly foundation consciousness appears to move with coming and going as if real though lacking true existence. Therefore, this does not accept foundation consciousness established by its own characteristics as explained in other texts.
Even if one does not accept the foundation consciousness as established by its own characteristics, if one thinks "I accept an illusion-like foundation consciousness that is different in nature from the six collections and contains all seeds of both samsaric and enlightened phenomena," then in accepting such a foundation consciousness, one must accept that appearances of form, sound, and so forth are merely the ripening of habitual tendencies and that external objects do not exist. As stated in that very text: "Consciousness realizes objects of knowledge; without objects of knowledge, there is no consciousness. Therefore, why not accept that neither object nor subject exists?" This shows that external objects of knowledge and internal consciousness are equal in terms of existence or non-existence - if one doesn't exist, the other cannot exist. This aligns with what is taught here regarding objects and consciousness being equal in both their conventional existence and ultimate non-existence, making it inappropriate to distinguish between their existence or non-existence in either of the two truths. Therefore, since the master does not accept a foundation consciousness separate from mental consciousness, when speaking of "foundation consciousness," it refers generally to mind as mere awareness and clarity, and specifically to mental consciousness - because it explains how activity is possible despite mind's lack of inherent existence, because mental consciousness takes birth in existence, and because it serves as the basis for all afflicted and purified phenomena.
In the Madhyamakahṛdaya, the literal interpretation of ālaya is refuted, and Master Jñānagarbha, because he accepts external objects, also does not accept the ālaya.
Among the Cittamātrins who refute external objects, there appear to be two types: those who accept ālayavijñāna (foundation consciousness) and those who do not. Master Kamalaśīla, who does not accept external objects, also maintains that mental consciousness (manovijñāna) alone possesses the power to connect with another birth. As quoted from the Abhidharmakośa: "Severance and connection, freedom from attachment, deterioration, death-transition, and birth are maintained to be mental consciousness alone." This clearly demonstrates that the great master Śāntarakṣita also does not accept ālayavijñāna. Abhayākara holds the same position.
Although in other Mahayana scriptures the term "all-ground consciousness" is mentioned, there does not appear to be any clear identification beyond merely understanding the name. When examining the meaning, it appears they only maintain that it is not distinct in essence from the six collections (of consciousness). And since that system appears to be on the side of accepting external objects, this name is applied to mental consciousness. Although these matters need to be established extensively, I have not written (more) out of fear of being too lengthy.
Third, not only did [the Buddha] teach the foundation consciousness and so forth initially in order to guide disciples, but also, just as the Buddha Bhagavan, though free from the view of the transitory collection together with its habitual tendencies and having abandoned all conceptual thoughts that grasp at "I" and "mine," nevertheless taught expressions of "I" and "mine" as a method for worldly beings to understand the meaning of the Dharma, similarly, although things do not exist inherently, teaching that they exist inherently is taught as provisional meaning as a method for worldly beings to gradually understand suchness.
In brief, according to what is stated as "I" and "mine", although it appears there are such conceptions, the definitive meaning is the absence of conceptions. Similarly, although the teaching that phenomena are inherently established appears to be the Buddha's intention, the definitive meaning is that phenomena do not exist in that way.
Regarding how to engage with conventional presentations in accordance with the world, as stated in verses according to the Eastern Mountain School: If the guides of the world do not engage in accordance with the world, no one would understand what Buddha nature is and who is Buddha. While maintaining that aggregates, elements, and sense bases have one nature, they teach about the three realms - this is engaging in accordance with the world. Teaching nameless dharmas to sentient beings through inconceivable names - this is engaging in accordance with the world. While demonstrating non-existence and abiding in Buddha nature, teaching that there is no non-existence here - this is engaging in accordance with the world. Not perceiving meaning and meaninglessness, yet teaching the supreme speech of cessation and ultimate meaning - this is engaging in accordance with the world. Though there is no destruction or arising, and while equal to the dharmadhātu, teaching about the kalpa of burning - this is engaging in accordance with the world. Though the nature of sentient beings is not observed in the three times, teaching about the realm of sentient beings - this is engaging in accordance with the world. Thus it is extensively taught.
Among these, the last verse teaches the selflessness of persons - the lack of intrinsic existence of sentient beings - and the remaining verses teach the selflessness of phenomena - the lack of intrinsic existence of things and non-things. Since the "Blaze of Reasoning" explains that the Eastern Mountain School gradually split off from the Mahāsāṃghika School, it appears there exists a Śrāvaka scriptural collection that very clearly teaches the lack of intrinsic existence of phenomena.
Second, the specific refutation of the Cittamātra system has three parts: (1) refuting intrinsically established consciousness without external objects, (2) refuting valid cognition that proves the intrinsic establishment of dependent nature, and (3) showing that the word 'only' in the teaching of mind-only does not negate external objects. The first has two parts: presenting others' system and refuting that system. Regarding the first: The Consciousness-Only proponents, being unable to accept the Madhyamaka system as previously explained and claiming it does not represent the Buddha's intention, establish their position by expressing a system constructed through their own conceptual elaborations. To clearly present their system as explained in their own texts, the opponent's position states: The bodhisattva dwelling in and meditating on the supreme perfection of wisdom on the sixth ground realizes suchness through reasoning, without erroneously superimposing subject-object substantial duality, and realizes, sees, and comprehends this as consciousness-only suchness.
Furthermore, because there are no external forms, mind and mental factors are understood to be merely dependently originated phenomena without external forms as their objects. Therefore, this is called the realization of suchness in terms of mere consciousness.
If one asks how this bodhisattva realizes suchness in this way: Because this bodhisattva, through the reasoning that will be explained about forms and so forth arising from the ripening of internal habitual tendencies, sees that there is no apprehended object that is a different substance from mind, and without that, sees no apprehender that is separate from the object. Having thoroughly realized that the three realms of existence are mere consciousness, they then cultivate familiarity with the suchness of emptiness of duality for a long time. Through such familiarity, they directly perceive through self-awareness the thing that is inexpressible in words as suchness - the mere nature of emptiness of duality. Therefore, through this process of previous familiarization, the bodhisattva on the sixth ground realizes the suchness of mere consciousness.
If these are merely cognitions without external objects, then how does mind-only bearing the aspects of external objects arise without external objects? The answer: Just as the great ocean that supports waves, when stirred and agitated by wind, transitions from its previous motionless state (as if sleeping) to waves that obtain their own form through competition and are perceived as flowing everywhere, similarly from the foundation consciousness (ālayavijñāna) - which contains seeds of all outer and inner phenomena - mere consciousness of impure dependent nature arises through the maturation of habitual tendencies. These tendencies were deposited in the foundation consciousness through the cessation of both afflictions like attachment and virtues like faith, according to their respective types. While ordinary beings conceive of this in terms of grasped and grasper divided into outer and inner, there exists not even the slightest object that is substantially different from consciousness.
This is like how those who assert Ishvara and others as causes say: "Just as a spider is the cause of spider webs, crystal is like [the cause] of waters, and bilanga is like [the cause] of branches, that [Ishvara] is the cause of all embodied beings." Just as those who speak of Ishvara and others as the agent of beings [say this], the proponents of alayavijnana also assert that it possesses all seeds by virtue of being the support of all objects that are observed by consciousness.
The difference is this: Īśvara is permanent while the ālayavijñāna is impermanent. Therefore, those who have become habituated to tīrthika views through many previous lifetimes are to be tamed through the explanation of the ālaya.

The meaning of the term "proponents of internal objects of knowledge" is that objects of knowledge are form, sound, and so forth, and these are not asserted to be external but rather are propounded to be internal entities of consciousness.
If the Cittamātrins accept form, sound, and so forth, then refuting their external nature would become merely arguing about names, because they posit these very forms and so forth that appear as external as being external. When this objection is raised, it is similar to saying that when Mādhyamikas refute intrinsic establishment of form and so forth while positing form and so forth, they are positing these very forms and so forth that appear to be intrinsically established as being intrinsically established. Therefore, arguing about their existence or non-existence is merely arguing about names. Since this appears to be a major difficult point for both philosophical systems, not only is the Madhyamaka approach difficult, but in this Cittamātra system as well, it is evident that if external objects are refuted, form and so forth would become non-existent, and if form and so forth are posited, external objects would also need to be posited. Although these points are difficult, I have not written more, fearing lengthiness.
Because the presentation of the scriptures is well-known to be as previously explained, therefore one must necessarily accept this which is the intrinsically established nature of the dependent nature. This is because it is accepted to be the cause and basis for the entire network of conceptual thoughts, such as grasping at the imputed existence of apprehended and apprehender things as substantially distinct.
The mistaken perception of a snake that has a rope as its basis cannot arise where there is no rope as its ground.
Just as illusions that are based on causes such as vases do not arise in regions of space that are without earth and so forth, similarly, if external objects do not exist, what kind of cause could there be for the conceptual misconception that misconceives blue and so forth as external? Therefore, one must necessarily accept the impure dependent nature that appears as dual apprehended-apprehender that are substantially different as the cause of the conceptual misconception that misconceives things as external, because that very basis of appearance is the cause of both bondage and liberation of affliction and purity.
According to both Madhyamaka and Cittamatra systems, when there exists a teaching showing that the basis of clinging—that which appears to sentient beings and to which they cling as truly existing in accordance with its appearance—is empty of its conceived object, then realizing such emptiness becomes the path. However, if instead of taking as the path the realization of emptiness that negates what ordinary beings cling to as truly existing, one establishes some other emptiness as truly existing, this cannot serve as an antidote to any subtle or coarse clinging to true existence that has existed since beginningless time, making such effort fruitless.
Thus, regarding the dependent nature that appears as duality, where subject and object appear as substantially distinct: the imagined nature that is the object of grasping at their existence as they appear does not exist. One correctly sees that this basis is empty of that object of negation. And that which remains here - the basis of emptiness and the emptiness itself - truly exists here. Through understanding this exactly as it is, one will come to excellently grasp the meaning of emptiness.
Here, what is presented as the prior position is the explanation from the Bodhisattvabhūmi and Madhyāntavibhāgaṭīkā of the meaning of "whatever is not in whatever" as explained above. As for the explanation of the meaning of "whatever is not in whatever" in the Uttaratantra commentary, it exists as a Madhyamaka way of explanation completely unlike the previous two, but I have not written it out for fear of being too lengthy.
That dependent nature arises from its own habitual tendencies alone, without external apprehended objects.
It exists inherently, and according to this system, it exists as having a nature that is ultimate and not the object of any elaborations of words and thoughts, because external and internal verbal expressions grasp the unanalyzed aspect.
In brief, the dependent nature has three distinguishing features: it arises without external objects, it exists by its own nature, and it is not an object of ultimate elaborations.
Since that which is to be analyzed is included within the category of inherently existent entities, it is not distinct from the three characteristics.
The statement that "dependent nature exists" does not mean mere existence, but rather a qualified existence. As Master Sthiramati states: "Unreal conceptualization exists," and "by its own nature" is the remainder of the statement. Since this is so, understanding this qualification becomes important later.
The second has two parts: an extensive explanation of the refutation and a concluding summary of that refutation. The first has three parts: (1) refuting the example of intrinsically established consciousness without external objects, (2) refuting the point that consciousness empty of objects arises from the power of latent tendencies, and (3) demonstrating that this refutation does not contradict meditation on unattractiveness. The first has two parts: refuting the dream example and refuting the example of seeing falling hairs. The first has three parts: (1) showing the dream example does not establish consciousness as intrinsically existent, (2) showing the dream example does not establish the absence of external objects during waking states, and (3) showing the dream example establishes all things as false. Regarding the first: If you Cittamātrins assert that external objects don't exist but mind exists through its own characteristics, where is your example for this? This must be examined.
The Cittamātra says: "For example, while sleeping in a very small room and being overcome by sleep, the elephants from a dreamed herd of mad elephants cannot exist in that room in any way. Therefore, just as in a dream, while external objects do not exist, this intrinsically established consciousness must definitely be accepted." To show that this too is without essence, it is explained: "That very example should be considered here - that is, analyzed."
What is to be examined? Just as there are no elephants as objects [in dreams], in my system there exists no mind that has the appearance of a herd of intoxicated cattle and is established by its own characteristics even in dreams, because it is unborn.
If consciousness is not established by its own characteristics, then at that time your example is not established for both parties; therefore, consciousness cannot exist without external objects.
Here, it is not teaching that consciousness qua subject does not exist just as an elephant appearing in a dream does not exist. Rather, one must definitely accept that it teaches the nonexistence of intrinsically established consciousness. This is because, as previously explained, the Cittamatra's acceptance of the dependent nature that lacks external objects is based on the dependent nature being intrinsically established. And in summarizing these refutations, when commenting on "In brief, just as there is no object of knowledge, there is no consciousness," it is clearly stated that consciousness possessing the aspects of objects of knowledge is not produced by its own nature.
Moreover, when refuting such types in both the root text and commentary, because there are many qualifications applied to the object of negation, and because it is also this system's own position when the great master states "Why did they teach that mind arises from ignorance and karma?" - that ignorance produces karmic formations and karmic formations produce consciousness - there is no basis for doubt among the discerning regarding claims that this system holds consciousness to be non-existent. Therefore, all instances of drawing equivalence between existence and non-existence with respect to objects of knowledge and consciousness should be understood from the perspective of the qualifications of the object of negation.
"If there is no mistaken consciousness in dreams, then upon waking one would not later remember the experiences from the time of the dream" - if one thinks this, this is an argument based on the assumption that if consciousness is not established by its own essence, then consciousness is completely nonexistent.
This argument is also not acceptable. If the mind of dreams were established by its own nature based on remembering the experience of dreams upon awakening, then external objects appearing in dreams, such as elephants, would also exist in the same way as that mind. Why? Just as you have a memory of the subject thinking "I saw during dream time" when awake, similarly since there is memory of experiencing objects thinking "I saw this object" at the time of dreaming regarding external objects, you must accept either that the objects exist or that consciousness also does not exist.
Well then, since memories of both the object and subject of dreams exist even in our own system, how should we understand their existence and non-existence? Here, the Commentary explains two things: memory of the dream experience and memory of experiencing the objects of the dream. When an elephant and so forth appears during a dream, for example, just as when seeing a reflection in a mirror, although the visual consciousness that perceives the reflection does not experience the mirror itself, there is still an experience of the object in relation to the reflection. Similarly, although there is no experience of an elephant during the dream, there is an experience of the object that appears. So even though we speak of "remembering the object," what is remembered is the experience of that object.
Differentiating between objects of perception and experience is unnecessary in many such cases, except for some occasions. Thus, a dependent nature that is empty of external objects and established by its own characteristics cannot be posited, because not only is a direct example impossible, but unlike the case of proving the existence of past and future lives where, although there is no direct example, it can be proved through other methods of logical formulation, there is no such example in this case either. Therefore, one should understand that the reasoning refuting the Cittamātra is extremely powerful.
As for the second point: If forms of elephants and so forth exist in dreams, then the visual consciousness that apprehends them would also have to exist in dreams. However, this is not reasonable, because when one is asleep, visual consciousness (that is, visual awareness) is impossible due to being disturbed by sleep. Therefore, forms such as elephants and so forth cannot be apprehended by the eye sense-sphere, and only mental consciousness exists. Thus, external form sense-spheres definitely do not exist, and when aspects of those external objects appear in mental consciousness, one unavoidably conceives of them as being external.
If one says that just as consciousness alone arises without external objects in dreams, so it is asserted to be in this waking state - this means that even if that previous example is not established, the dream example establishes consciousness without external objects in the waking state. This is not so, because it is impossible for mental consciousness to arise in dreams. What is stated here means that even if we grant there are no visual form-fields in dreams, mental consciousness inherently established without those is impossible even in dreams. Therefore, the combination of the absence of external objects and the inherent existence of mental consciousness is not suitable as an example.
Just as according to you external objects are not born in dreams, likewise mental consciousness too is not produced by its own nature. Therefore, just as when awake and seeing form, the three - eye, form and mind - come together, likewise when comprehending objects in dreams too, the coming together of the three is observed by the intellect.
Just as in a dream there are no eyes and visual forms, likewise the visual consciousness that is produced by these two also does not exist. Therefore, all three - the dream eyes, forms, and mental faculty - are false.
Similarly to those three, the remaining three [sense faculties] of the ear and so forth beyond those three of the eye also lack inherent production.
Here, the term "and so on" includes everything from sound and ear consciousness up through mind, dharma-element, and mental consciousness. As explained, the four from ear faculty through body faculty, the four from sound through tactile sources, and the four including ear consciousness and others are, like the three aspects of eye previously explained, false because although they do not exist in dreams, they appear as their aspects. The three mental factors, though present in dreams, are false because they appear while lacking inherent existence. Therefore, those who claim this master's position includes the existence of sense consciousness in dreams and then refute it demonstrate extremely crude understanding. As is said, "The sun of refutation rises before the dawn of the opponent's position" - such approaches should be thoroughly rejected. Some who pride themselves as Tibetan scholars fail to understand even the basic systems of those they know, yet make them objects for accumulating negative karma and lead many beings toward non-virtue. Be vigilant about this!
Here, when the Cittamātrins establish their own system as explained in the statement beginning "If in sleep...", Master Bhaviveka responds that the example is not established, saying: "In dreams, there exists a form belonging to the dharma-āyatana that is to be apprehended by mental consciousness; therefore, consciousness never exists without an object." Regarding this, his position too is incorrect because the three components cannot possibly exist in any aspect within dreams. If one accepts this merely to refute the opponent's system, then the dream example becomes meaningless, because if it had non-false content, it could not demonstrate that the actual meaning derived from the example has false content. The meaning of this statement is that the three elements - object, sense faculty, and consciousness - cannot possibly exist by way of their own nature in any aspect, even in dreams.
It should be explained that it is not reasonable for there to be an object other than consciousness of form in the domain of mental phenomena in dreams. At that time, one must also accept that form itself, and it is not contradictory for that to exist in dreams as well. Therefore, since it is clear that Bhāviveka accepts that form as established by its own characteristics, this should be taken as the reason for its non-existence.
If one accepts that form exists through its own characteristics in order to refute the Cittamātra position (which uses dreams as an example to show that there are no external form objects belonging to the external sense spheres), then at that time there would be no purpose in the Mādhyamika presenting the dream example to prove the lack of true existence.
The dream has meaningful content that is not false, because it is established by its own characteristics as arising from the example. It is impossible for the actual object that is exemplified by that to be established as false, because until intrinsic existence is refuted, there is no pervasion of the sign, property and example that establishes the lack of true existence. Therefore, the earlier response from our own system that all appearances in dreams are not intrinsically established is excellent.
If asked whether according to our own system the forms that appear clearly in dreams are accepted as dharma-āyatana forms or not: Since there are no sense consciousnesses in dreams, what appear as the five objects appear only to mental consciousness. Therefore, although the five sense sources such as form cannot be posited there, just as the clear appearance of a skeleton to mind alone is included as a dharma-āyatana, they are dharma-āyatana forms. Moreover, among its five forms, they are imputed forms. Through this, many such cases should be understood.
Third: Because all three - what appear as objects, sense faculties, and consciousness in dreams - are unreal, therefore, in order to establish those phenomena that have not yet been established as lacking true existence through the means of establishing that dreams lack true existence, it is explained that even when awake, all phenomena will be established as lacking inherent nature.
Just as objects, sense faculties, and consciousnesses in dreams are false, likewise here in the waking state too, all things are false. Therefore, the mind does not exist inherently. Similarly, the objects of the sense faculties such as forms and so forth do not exist, and the sense faculties themselves do not arise inherently. Therefore, as stated in the sūtra: "Just as illusory beings are perceived, though they appear, they are not real in ultimate reality. The Sugata taught that phenomena are like illusions and dreams." And: "The beings of existence are like dreams - here no one is born or dies. No sentient being, human, or life force can be found. These phenomena are like bubbles and plantain trees." Thus it is well explained.
The phrase "no one is born" and so forth should be applied with the qualification "in reality" as used in the phrase "in reality, not real" when making a negation. These sutras explain through the example of dreams that all phenomena are not established in reality - this works for Madhyamaka but does not work for Cittamatra, therefore it is said to become a good explanation.
Therefore, in this world, although there exists the sleep of ignorance, for some who are awake by being free from ordinary sleep that is distinct from that [ignorance], although nothing arises through its own nature, within the perspective of what appears in dreams due to the sleep of ignorance, all three exist. Similarly, for those who are not free from sleep and not awake, as long as that state continues, for them - that is, from their perspective - the three factors of object, sense faculty, and consciousness also exist.
When awakening from sleep, just as the three aspects of a dream do not exist, likewise for the Buddhas who have directly realized the dharmadhātu through completely exhausting and eradicating the sleep of ignorance, since none of the three aspects exist, there is no consciousness without external objects.
Furthermore, from the perspective of seeing things as they are, the three do not appear. And from the perspective of seeing things in their full extent, although there is no appearance due to the power of the subject itself being corrupted by the latent tendencies of ignorance, the Buddha knows those things that appear due to the power of other beings' corrupted consciousness through their appearing to those beings.
Second: If one objects, "Since those with eye disease perceive nonexistent floating hairs and so forth, consciousness must exist inherently even though external objects do not exist," that too is untenable.
Why is this? When someone whose eye faculty is affected by a visual disorder sees hair-like shapes through the power of that disorder, then from the perspective of that person's consciousness, both the visual consciousness and the aspect of the hair-like shapes—that is, the object appearing as hair-like shapes—exist.
From the perspective of clear vision - that is, seeing with eyes free from eye disease - both the appearance of hair strands and the consciousness that perceives that appearance are false, meaning unborn, because it is difficult to ascertain that consciousness exists without even a merely appearing object. This must definitely be accepted as such.
That is not so. If, for someone with eye disease, there were to arise a naturally established cognition having the aspect of floating hair despite there being no floating hair to be cognized, then wherever that person with eye disease sees floating hair, even someone whose eye is directed at that same place but who lacks eye disease would develop a cognition seeing floating hair, just like the person with eye disease, because both are equal in lacking an object.
Just as if something inherently established were to arise from another, it would follow that it would arise from everything that is other, similarly if an inherently established consciousness were to arise, given that the object (floating hair) is equally non-existent for both, it would be inconsistent that the perception of it arises in one with eye disease but does not arise in one without eye disease, because that consciousness, being able to be established without depending on the eye disease, would become unrelated.
Since it is not the case that a cognition perceiving floating hairs arises in those without eye disease, therefore there is no consciousness that is inherently established without external objects.
The second has three parts: (1) refuting that consciousness perceiving objects arises and does not arise from ripened and unripened habitual tendencies; (2) refuting the restatement of how consciousness exists without external objects; and (3) showing there is no scriptural contradiction in refuting the Cittamātra system. The first has two parts: stating others' position and refuting that position. Regarding the first: If the existence of objects like appearing hairs were the cause of consciousness arising, then even those without eye disease would see appearing hairs, but this is not the case. What then? The ripening and non-ripening of previously established habitual tendencies are the causes of consciousness arising and not arising. Therefore, only those individuals who have ripened habitual tendencies established by previous consciousness having the aspect of hairs will experience consciousness having the aspect of hairs.
If one argues: Because those without eye disease have not ripened the habitual patterns that are the potential of the mind which appears as floating hairs when seeing objects, therefore those without eye disease do not develop the cognition that sees floating hairs - it is not that such cognition does not arise due to the absence of the actual thing that exists as a knowable object in the form of floating hairs.
The second has three parts: refuting inherently established power in the present, refuting inherently established power in the future, and refuting inherently established power in the past. First: If there were something called "power" that was inherently established, then at that time, although one might allow for consciousness arising or not arising from the ripening or non-ripening of that power, since that inherently established power does not exist, this is not established.
How is it not established? When examining this potential, would it be something connected with present consciousness, or would it become something connected with past and future consciousness? Regarding that, first, there is no possibility of an inherently established potential in what has arisen - that is, the present. Nor is there any potential in the nature of what has not arisen - the future.
Regarding this: if one asserts that potential exists in present consciousness, both consciousness and potential would become simultaneous. At that time, when the relationship between potential and potential-possessor is expressed by the sixth case as "consciousness of potential," since these two cannot be separate entities, it is not reasonable for the consciousness of potential to exist as the potential itself. If it did exist that way, the effect would become something without any cause other than itself, and even when the sprout has arisen, the seed would not disintegrate.
When there is the fifth case relationship between potential and that which has potential, expressed as "consciousness from potential," it is not reasonable for consciousness that has arisen to arise from a potential that is simultaneous with it, because the effect would exist at the time of the cause. Therefore, for now, there is no causal potential for present consciousness.
As for the second: If there exists potential in unborn consciousness, then when applying the phrase "potential of consciousness," potential is the basis of qualification and consciousness is the qualifying property. Regarding that, future unborn consciousness cannot be taught as having the nature of an affirmative statement "it is consciousness," nor can it be taught as having the nature of a negation established by its own nature saying "it is not consciousness."
When future consciousness does not exist as present consciousness, what could distinguish the potential saying "this potential is the potential of this consciousness"? It cannot.
Thus, without a distinguishing consciousness, there cannot exist a capacity that has been qualified by it. If it were not so, it would absurdly follow that even a barren woman's son would have such a capacity.
If a consciousness arises from potential, thinking about this, one might say "this is the potential of this consciousness and from this potential this consciousness will arise," thus establishing them as qualifier and qualified. Just as in the world when one says "Cook the rice!" or "Weave cloth from this thread!" thinking of the future rice and cloth, and just as in the Treasury where it states "There are three types of womb entry: the universal monarch and the two self-arising ones," speaking of those who will become universal monarchs entering the womb, similarly one might claim to designate the potential of consciousness while thinking of future consciousness. However, this is meaningless. If something exists occasionally, its effect will arise later, but that which never arises at any time - like a barren woman's son or unconditioned space - will not arise either now or later. Therefore, even if one accepts consciousness arising when there is inherently established potential, since future consciousness does not inherently exist at any time, there is absolutely no potential to produce it. Thus, like a barren woman's son, without inherently established potential to produce consciousness, no inherently established consciousness can arise.
When Madhyamikas refute the establishment of a sprout's arising through its own characteristics in many contexts, they present the following extreme consequence: "If a sprout can arise despite not existing at the time of the seed, then rabbit horns and such would also arise." The key point of presenting such an extreme consequence is that if a sprout established by its own characteristics does not exist at one point, it must never exist at any time, thus becoming equivalent to something utterly nonexistent. This is not meant to refute the general principle that something can arise despite not existing previously. This same reasoning applies to examples like cooked rice, because if things arose inherently, even future things like cooked rice would necessarily be completely nonexistent.
Furthermore, the potential is posited in dependence upon the existence of future consciousness, and if consciousness is posited in dependence upon the potential, saying "consciousness arises from the potential," then they would be established through mutual dependence. If that is accepted, then the noble ones possessing supreme wisdom have taught that consciousness is not established by its own nature.
In the commentary, relationally established things such as long-short and far-near exist as mere imputations, but are stated to lack natural establishment. Therefore, one should understand the distinctions that this is not refuting establishment in general, but rather refuting establishment through intrinsic nature. If one speaks in this way, they will come to follow our way of speaking. Thus, consciousness also has no power over the future.
Third, now to show that there is also no power over the past, it is explained: If a consciousness that has arisen and is ceasing places a special potency of latent tendencies in the foundation consciousness for the sake of a result concordant with itself, and if future consciousness arises from the maturation of the potency of the ceased consciousness, then a different resultant consciousness would arise from the potency of something inherently established as different. Why? Because according to you, in the sequence where momentary [phenomena] with continuity arise, the earlier and later are inherently different from each other.
Moreover, from the root gyun, regarding ta nu meaning "to expand," when the affix is added, it becomes gyun (continuum) through transmission. Like the flow of a river, when causes and effects operate in continuous connection, the process of birth and death continues without gaps or interruption. This refers to the conditioned phenomena that are momentary appropriators of the three times. The moments are parts of a whole, not merely an uninterrupted sequence of before and after. Since the momentary substances that are parts of the continuum exist within it, the momentary substances that are members of the continuum are called "possessors of continuum." Because the parts and members belong to that continuum, the continuum is called their "appropriator," just as a pot is the appropriator of its lip, neck, and so forth.
Those earlier and later moments are mutually different and distinct from each other, and the opponent accepts them as being different by way of being established by their own characteristics. Thus, something arises from the power of another that is established by its own nature.
If you think "it is not a fault because it is desired," therefore all things would arise from all other things different from themselves.
Even though in the sequential functioning of earlier and later moments, the momentary substantial entities of the continuum are different from each other through inherent establishment, nevertheless, regarding those earlier and later moments, the continuum has no difference - it is exclusively one. Therefore, you may say there is no fault of everything arising from everything. [In response:] This [claim that] earlier and later [moments] are one continuum is the main response attempting to avoid the extreme consequence in other-arising.
If a single continuum were established for inherently established separate entities of before and after, even if we accept there would be no fault, this single continuum is not established, therefore this single continuum is something to be proven. Why? Because it is not reasonable for there to be an undifferentiated continuum for those that are inherently established as different before and after. For example, just as those belonging to the continuums of Maitreya and Upagupta, being different individuals, are not included in a single continuum, similarly, those before and after that are established by their own characteristics as separate cannot reasonably be included in a single continuum. Thus, this addresses the fault of the extreme consequence charged against other-arising.
When they say "Since rice seeds and sprouts are of one continuum but barley sprouts are not of the same continuum, everything does not arise from everything," they cannot avoid the flaw. The key point is that the opponent accepts otherness that is established by own-characteristics. While it is extremely clear this is not directed at mere otherness, some make arguments about shared exclusions without understanding the qualification "otherness established by own-characteristics." By leaving aside Candrakīrti's own explanation of why the opponent cannot avoid the flaw and fabricating explanations he did not give, they corrupt the perfect philosophical system.
The second has two parts: stating others' system and refuting that system. First: Having presented their position thus far, and thinking they would accomplish their desired aim primarily by stating their own system again, the Cittamātrins said: When other consciousnesses are in the process of ceasing, they immediately deposit in the ālayavijñāna whatever habitual tendencies that are their own potential for producing eye consciousness. Later, from the ripening of those tendencies, an eye consciousness arises that follows the aspect of that previous consciousness.
That which serves as the basis - the uninterrupted moment of potentiality from which one's eye consciousness arises from an uninterrupted moment of potentiality - is what worldly beings, due to ignorance, understand to be the physical eye faculty. However, there exists no eye faculty that is separate from consciousness. This should likewise be applied to the remaining physical sense faculties.
Regarding that, the latent tendencies that are the cause of the arising of eye consciousness are its causal condition, and the eye faculty is the dominant condition of eye consciousness.
Here, teaching that the eye faculty is the direct cause of visual consciousness refers to the occasion when the latent tendencies for the arising of visual consciousness have matured, not to whatever eye faculty there might be.
Furthermore, from the Madhyāntavibhāga: "Consciousness manifesting as appearances of objects, sentient beings, and self arises abundantly, but those objects do not exist." This statement that consciousness arises appearing as objects such as form and as the five sense faculties of sentient beings refers to the foundation consciousness (ālayavijñāna). And since Master Sthiramati also explained the physical sense faculties as objects of the foundation consciousness, those Cittamātrins who accept the foundation consciousness assert that what appears as physical sense faculties to the foundation consciousness are the eye faculty and so forth.
Having shown that there are no sense faculties such as the eye faculty that are separate from consciousness, in order to show that forms too do not exist as separate objects from consciousness, it is said: In this world, the five types of consciousness that arise from the five sense faculties, without there being external objects to be grasped such as blue and so forth, arise as appearances of blue and so forth from the ripening of seeds deposited in the alaya consciousness itself. Not understanding this, ordinary beings cling to the appearances of blue and so forth in their mind as external objects to be grasped.
